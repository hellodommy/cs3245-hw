YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This case concerned a disposal inquiry in respect of three vehicles seized in the course of police investigations. During the inquiry, both the petitioners and the respondent claimed entitlement to possession of the vehicles. The district judge ordered that the vehicles be delivered to the respondent. The petitioners filed a petition for the revision of the order made below. I dismissed the petition and now give my reasons.
 2.
 A preliminary point
There seemed no agreement in the court below between the parties involved on the question whether the inquiry was held pursuant to s 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC) or s 392 of the CPC. In their submissions, the petitioners assumed s 386 of the CPC to be the applicable section. The respondent relied upon s 386 of the CPC on the first page of his written submissions but, later, in the same set of submissions, cited s 392 of the CPC as the applicable section. From the notes of evidence, the investigating officer appears to have thought the relevant section to be s `382` of the CPC. The district judge did not comment on which section he applied nor whether he acted in his capacity as a magistrate, as required by s 392 of the CPC, or as a district judge. During the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondent cited s 392 of the CPC as the relevant section while counsel for the petitioner did not mention which section of the CPC the case involved.
 3.The relevant section is s 392 of the CPC. This is because no prosecution was commenced after the police investigations. Accordingly, there has been no `inquiry or trial in any criminal court` within the meaning of s 386 of the CPC. Previously, in 
Magnum Finance Bhd v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 523
 , I stated, for the same reason, that this is the disposal provision to apply in cases where there has been no prosecution. No prejudice, however, has been occasioned by the confusion in the court below, as the inquiry only concerned the disposal of property between rival claimants and this discretion is similarly exercised under both sections. No power peculiar to s 386 of the CPC was involved. I therefore proceeded to deal with the petition on the footing that the inquiry had been held pursuant to s 392 of the CPC.
 4.
 The law in respect of disposal inquiries held pursuant to s 392(1) of the CPC
Section 392(1) of the CPC is as follows: 
The seizure by any police officer of property taken under section 29 or alleged or suspected to have been stolen, or found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence shall be forthwith reported to a Magistrate`s Court which shall make such order as it thinks fit respecting the delivery of the property to the person entitled to possession of it or, if that person cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of the property.

 Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP f 
Somewhat surprisingly, there is scant local precedent on the exercise of a magistrate`s discretion pursuant to s 392 of the CPC. 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
, which I mentioned earlier, is a case which really concerned s 386 and dealt only with the question of when s 392 of the CPC is to apply. Nevertheless, some of the precedents on s 386(1) of the CPC, insofar as they deal purely with the distribution of property between rival claimants, would seem applicable to disposal inquiries held pursuant to s 392(1) of the CPC. Using this approach, the following principles appear to be relevant to a disposal inquiry conducted under s 392 of the CPC: (i). A disposal inquiry is intended to be an inexpensive and expeditious manner of distributing items produced in the course of investigations or at trial: 
Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 414
 .
 (ii). Such an inquiry is not conclusive as to title. The rightful owner can and should assert his rights in a separate civil suit: .
 (iii). There is no right of appeal against an order made pursuant to a disposal inquiry: 
Sofjan & Anor v PP
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 272
 .
 (iv). Where there is a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice, the court may exercise its revisionary jurisdiction: .
 6.From the preceding paragraph, it is clear that while the perimeters of a magistrate`s discretion and the High Court`s powers have been delineated with precision, no rules have been set out in respect of situations where entitlement to possession is disputed. In this connection, counsel for the petitioners advocated the approach found in the Indian case of 
Purshottam Das v State
 
[1952] Cr LJ 856
. In dealing with a provision of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code similar to the section under discussion, Desai J stated at p 860: 
A magistrate is not a civil court and has no power to decide disputes about title. There was nothing in s 523 to authorise a magistrate to decide which party is the rightful owner of the property. His enquiry is limited to finding which person is entitled to possession. 
 Once he ascertains the person from whose possession the property is seized, he must hold him to be entitled to its possession unless his possession was unlawful
. [Emphasis added.]
 7.The first part of the extract is unremarkable and I have no quarrel with it. It is clear from the local precedents and indeed, s 392 itself, that the magistrate may not make binding decisions about title to property. Counsel for the petitioners, however, relied on the portion highlighted in italics to set out a simple three-point test: first, the magistrate should ascertain the possessor at the time of seizure; secondly, he should ascertain if such possession was unlawful; and thirdly, in the absence of unlawful possession, the property should be returned as a matter of course to the person in whose possession it was immediately prior to seizure by the police.
 8.I cannot agree that a magistrate must be constrained to such a simplistic approach. Suppose, for example, that X, who holds title, loans his property to Y for a day, who would then be in possession as a lawful licensee. At the end of the day, the property is seized from Y during police investigations, through no fault of X or Y. Although Y would be the party in possession at the time of seizure, Y could not possibly dispute that it is X who is entitled to possession. Although Desai J`s observation that the magistrate is unable to decide questions of title is a correct one, the mere inability to
 decide 
 questions as to title does not and cannot lead to an inability to 
 have regard 
to the party who holds title. Title and possession are related concepts. In many cases, the right to possession arises from the fact of having title. In other cases, although a party holds title, he may not, for various reasons, be the party entitled to possession: for instance, if he has leased his property to another for a period which has not expired.
 9.In my view, a magistrate having charge of a disposal inquiry cannot abdicate his responsibilities by applying the three-step 
 Purshottam Das 
 test. He must look to the facts of each case to ascertain the party who is entitled to possession. In some cases, entitlement to possession will be plain from the facts presented. In other cases, he may not be so fortunate. But even where such entitlement is not clear from the evidence, the magistrate still ought to deliver possession to the party to whom, after a consideration of the evidence, appears to him to be entitled to possession. In such cases, the magistrate is severely handicapped by the lack of pre-inquiry disclosure of documents and evidence. As a result, his judgment must, in a sense, be exercised in a somewhat `rough and ready` fashion. This may be justified by the object of disposal inquiries, which is to achieve an expeditious method of distributing items no longer relevant to police investigations or court proceedings. It should be noted, in this context, as it was in 
 Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan 
, that the magistrate`s ruling has no effect on a civil court, which is the correct forum in which to test complex issues of fact and law. In such cases, any party aggrieved ought to commence civil proceedings. A petition for revision is not the appropriate route. As I said in 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
, the High Court`s power of revision is only exercised where there has been a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice. It was with these principles in mind that I considered the petition for revision.
 10.
 The disposal inquiry in the court below
This disposal inquiry concerned a car with registration number SBU 2462 (the Nissan); a pick-up truck with registration number GJ 4328 (the pick-up); and a van with registration number YF 2867Z (the van). The Nissan was owned by one Sim Cheng Khim (Sim) (the deceased) whilst the pick-up and the van were owned by Golden Horse Trading Pte Ltd (Golden Horse), a dormant company owned by Sim. The Nissan was transferred to Sim`s husband, one Lee Eng Soon (the respondent) and the other two vehicles were transferred to his company, Jean Tex Trading Pte Ltd (Jean Tex) between August and December 1994. On 2 March 1995, Sim lodged a police report alleging that her signature had been forged on the instruments of transfer. In the course of the ensuing police investigation, the vehicles were seized from the possession of the respondent. Meanwhile, on 8 August 1995, Sim died. In her will, she bequeathed all her property `whatsoever and wheresoever situate` to her trustees to hold on trust for her mother. The two petitioners are the executors of her estate.
 11.After 18 months, upon the completion of their investigation, the police decided not to prosecute the respondent. A disposal inquiry was convened to distribute the three vehicles and both the petitioners and the respondent claimed entitlement to the vehicles.
 12.During the disposal inquiry, the investigating officer, S/S/Sgt Robert Kau, produced the police report in which Sim contended that the respondent had forged her signature on the transfer form for all three vehicles. He testified that he had sent the transfer forms for the pick-up and the van to the Department of Scientific Services (DSS) for signature analysis. On cross-examination by counsel for the respondent, he revealed that the form for the Nissan had not been sent because Sim had informed him that that was `her transfer form`.
 13.Counsel for the petitioners sought to prove the estate`s claim by adducing three categories of evidence: first, evidence that Sim`s signatures had been forged without her knowledge; secondly, her statements to the same effect, particularly those made in a will dated 7 February 1995; and thirdly, evidence that her relationship with her husband was poor prior to her death.
 14.In order to show that Sim had no prior knowledge of the transfer, an officer from the company from which the vehicles had been hire-purchased, Jeffrey Lim, was called. He testified that Sim telephoned Wayfoong Mortgage & Finance (S) Pte Ltd in January 1995 to enquire about the outstanding account for the Nissan. When informed that the account had been settled by a cash payment and the vehicles had been released to the respondent, she expressed surprise and said `it can`t be settled`.
 15.To prove that the signatures were forged, the DSS officer was called. He testified both in respect of the report he gave the police, as well as a later report requested by the executors. In the first report made for the purposes of the police investigation, he compared the signatures on the transfer forms for the van and pick-up with Sim`s specimen signatures. In the second report for the executors, he compared the release letter given to Wayfoong Mortgage by the respondent with Sim`s specimen signatures. He testified that the maker of the specimen signatures was not the same person as the maker of the signatures on the release letter and transfer forms. On cross-examination, he stated that illness could affect a person`s signature, but was of the view that none of the signatures exhibited was made by a person with terminal illness because the muscle control was still sound. He was of the opinion that the transfer form and release letter signatures were stiff and heavy, which could be the result of someone trying to imitate another`s handwriting. He was unable to conclude, however, that the respondent was responsible for the forgery. Owing to the fact that the specimen signature provided by the respondent was in Chinese, there was no basis for comparing the Chinese signature with the forged signatures.
 16.The second main area of the executors` evidence centred on the will dated 7 February 1995. By her will, Sim bequeathed all her property to her mother. At para 5, she explained her omission to provide for her husband in the following terms: 
I declare that my reason for making no provision in this my will for my husband Lee Eng Soon @ Lee Son is that there is no longer any husband-wife relationship between us since he fraudulently forged my signature and transferred my car to himself and also transferred my property Blk 7 #11-11 Melville Park Singapore to his mother without my prior approval.
 The solicitors who were responsible for drafting the will were called as witnesses. Jupiter Kong, former solicitor for Sim while he was at Lee & Lee, stated that the word `car` in para 5 ought to have been in the plural, because he was initially instructed in respect of the unlawful transfer of ownership of three cars and an apartment. On the other hand, Stacey Ong, who was responsible for drafting the will, testified that she had read the will to Sim on the telephone and Sim had confirmed that the will reflected her intentions.
 17.Both petitioners and a social worker named Cathy Lim were called to testify in respect of Sim`s complaints against the respondent. However, most of the questions asked were disallowed on the ground of hearsay and nothing of substance was adduced from these witnesses.
 18.The respondent, for his part, relied on the following four facts: that the police decided not to charge him with any offence; that he was and is the holder of the legal title; that he was in possession immediately prior to the seizure of the vehicles; and that all three vehicles were paid for by Jean Tex Trading Pte Ltd (Jean Tex), a company he now owns.
 19.The respondent`s evidence was that he married Sim in 1992. From sometime in 1990 until July 1994, he was an undischarged bankrupt. Both the pick-up and the van, he said, were purchased prior to his marriage. The pick-up was held in the name of Jean Tex, which was then owned by one Lee Jee Kok, and the van was owned by his mother. The pick-up was transferred, without fee, to Sim`s dormant company, Golden Horse, sometime in 1992 when Jean Tex was in financial trouble. The van was transferred to Golden Horse in 1992 also, again without fee, because his mother was `getting old`. The Nissan was purchased in Sim`s name in 1992, but he contended that Jean Tex paid for its purchase. Sim did not possess a driving licence. At all times, the three vehicles were used for the purposes and in the possession of Jean Tex. He became the proprietor of Jean Tex on 10 October 1994, after the annulment of his bankruptcy. He testified that Sim agreed to transfer the vehicles to him in late 1994, and furnished him with her identity card for this purpose. She signed the transfer forms and release letter in hospital, while he was out buying her lunch.
 20.At the end of the inquiry, the magistrate ordered that the vehicles be delivered to the respondent.
 21.
 The petition for revision
Counsel for the petitioners raised three main grounds for revision: first, that the magistrate had given insufficient attention to the DSS reports that Sim`s signatures had been forged; secondly, that insufficient emphasis had been placed on Sim`s statements in her will and to witnesses that the respondent had caused the unlawful transfer of the vehicles to himself; and lastly, as a related submission to the second ground, that the magistrate had erred in refusing to admit statements made by Sim to others about her relationship with the respondent and the respondent`s role in the transfer of her vehicles.
 22.In my view, the evidence in respect of the forged signatures was the most significant issue raised in the petition. Both in the court below and before me, counsel for the respondent made much of the fact that no prosecution has been brought against the respondent. This, in my opinion, was irrelevant. If the transfer forms had been forged, regardless of who had forged them or how they had been forged, it would appear that the title to the vehicles would have remained with Sim and, on her death, passed to her estate. Nevertheless, as a result of the aborted investigations, there has been no finding of fact in any court of competent jurisdiction that the transfer forms were indeed forged. For this reason, I looked very carefully at the evidence adduced to prove the forgeries. Unfortunately, I found the evidence unsatisfactory in several respects. On this point, the petitioners` case hinged on the DSS reports. The initial DSS report, however, only dealt with the transfer forms for the pick-up and the van. The Nissan form was excluded because, on S/S/Sgt Kau`s evidence, Sim had informed him that it was `her transfer form`. The omission of evidence on the Nissan transfer form was a serious lacuna in the petitioners` case. In an attempt to remedy the loophole, counsel for the petitioners then requested that the third form be sent as well. Owing to objections made by counsel for the respondent on the grounds that the magistrate had no power to order the further analysis, the magistrate refused the application. Nevertheless, on 23 April 1997, after the close of the respondent`s case, when the magistrate adjourned the hearing to 6 June 1997 for written submissions, he gave the petitioners leave to subpoena the DSS officer, if they thought fit. The DSS officer was called as a witness on 7 June 1997. It was at this hearing that he tendered his second report, dated 16 May 1997. In the report, he compared the signature on the Wayfoong Mortgage release form, which the respondent had tendered to obtain possession of the Nissan, with Sim`s specimen signature and concluded that the makers of both signatures were different. Again, no evidence as to the signature on the Nissan transfer form was led.
 23.In addition, there appeared to be some inconsistency in Sim`s various comments on the issue of the documents being forged. Although she reported to the police, the executors and Jupiter Kong that all three vehicles had been transferred without her authority, she informed S/S/Sgt Robert Kau that the transfer form for the Nissan was `her transfer form`. Moreover, para 5 of her will, drafted by Stacey Ong upon her specific instructions, referred only to `car` in the singular.
 24.This case was further complicated by both sides` treatment of the respondent`s evidence, through the production of cheque stubs and receipts, that Jean Tex had funded the initial purchase of the vehicles. Counsel for the respondent laid emphasis on this fact, but as I pointed out at the hearing, the log-book of a vehicle is its index of title: the funding of the purchases, without more, could not be a reason to deliver possession of the vehicles to the respondent. The respondent 
 could 
 have argued, based on such funding, that a resulting trust existed in his favour and that Sim, even prior to the transfers of title, was only a `bare trustee` with none of the benefits of ownership; that the respondent as the beneficial owner would have been entitled, at any point, to have asked for possession, and indeed, the transfer of the bare legal title to himself: see 
Saunders v Vautier
 
[1841] Cr & Ph 240
. This he did not do. His omission was complicated by the fact that this type of resulting trust is merely a presumption of intention which may be contradicted by evidence that the parties intended the contrary. Of relevance in the present case was the fact that Sim was the respondent`s wife and, as such, a `presumption of advancement` could be applicable to show that the husband intended the cars to be gifts: see 
Tinker v Tinker
 
[1970] 1 All ER 540
. This point was not taken by counsel for the petitioners either. In consequence, no evidence was led by either side as to the intent of the parties. For the petitioners, their omission may have arisen because Sim had informed them that she had paid for the cars and that her bag of documents was missing. Prior to the hearing, too, they were unaware of the respondent`s cheque stubs and receipts. As for counsel for the respondent, his omission may have arisen, in part, from his misplaced reliance on 
 Purshottam Das v State 
.
 25.From the preceding paragraphs, it would appear that there was a tremendous conflict of evidence which remained unresolved after the proceedings in the court below. No doubt some of the confusion may have been occasioned by the informal nature of a disposal inquiry and the ancillary lack of procedure for the proper discovery or inspection of documents found in civil and criminal proceedings. Be that as it may, I was not persuaded to exercise my revisionary jurisdiction, as it cannot, in the circumstances, be said that the magistrate`s decision resulted in a clear failure of justice. The respondent was the holder of the legal title and was in possession prior to the seizure. If the police had not seized the vehicles, the petitioners would have had the onus of commencing a claim in conversion and of proving the forgery. In order to prove that claim, proper discovery of documents would be necessary, the DSS reports would be perused in advance by the respondent, who would then be entitled to call his own expert to contest the allegations made. The respondent`s evidence as to payment would also be properly tested and any arguments in respect of a resulting trust or gift would be canvassed properly before the court. The magistrate`s order was merely a return to status quo and the petitioners are not constrained by this order in subsequent civil proceedings. Conversely, if the magistrate had ordered the delivery of the vehicles to the respondent, his order would have been limited to possession only. If it could be shown that notwithstanding the respondent`s legal title, he was plainly not entitled to possession, then mere possession would have sufficed for the petitioners` purposes. It was obvious from the evidence, however, that this was not the situation at hand.
 26.In my judgment, this case highlighted the inadequacy of a disposal inquiry as a forum to adjudicate complex issues of civil law. In such inquiries, there are no proper procedures for all pertinent issues to be set out and for evidence to be discovered and contested in an orderly fashion. This arises, no doubt, from their purpose, which is merely to distribute items no longer relevant to pending police investigations or criminal proceedings. Where it is plain from the facts and law which party ought to obtain possession, a magistrate`s failure to exercise his discretion correctly could be taken to be a fundamental error. Where entitlement to possession is complex, on the other hand, the magistrate must, by force of circumstances, do justice between the parties in a somewhat `rough and ready` manner. In such cases, canvassing the same issues again on a petition for revision is inappropriate.
 27.In the present case, upon receipt of information that the police were not proceeding with charges against the respondent, the petitioners ought to have commenced civil proceedings against the respondent for conversion immediately. If those proceedings had finished prior to the disposal inquiry and the petitioners had been adjudged the rightful owners, then it would have been a fundamental error for the magistrate to have ignored that finding. Even if those proceedings had not been completed prior to the disposal inquiry, several avenues would still have been open to the petitioners to allow them to protect their interest. First, they could have persuaded the magistrate to release the vehicles to the respondents on a bond to return them if the civil court should find favourably for the petitioners. This is an approach suggested by the Malaysian courts where an appeal is pending: 
PP v Peh Choo Key
 [1970] MLJ 136 . Alternatively, they could have persuaded the magistrate to retain the vehicles or their proceeds in the custody of the court, subject to any order of the civil court. This is the approach advocated by several Indian authorities: 
 Ramphal 
 40 CWN 862, 
 Ram Khalawan 
 28 CWN 1094, 
 Visa Samta 
 16 Cr LJ 111. I should mention that, in two of these cases, the order appears to have been made regardless of whether a civil suit was actually pending. This approach is not recommended, for, if no civil suit is commenced, the order would be of an uncertain duration. In any event, these possibilities were moot in the present case, because no civil proceedings were in fact afoot.","1997-10-13 00:00:00","SG High Court"

 The appellant was tried and convicted in the magistrate court on the following charge: 
You
 
Tan Lay Wah, F/34 yrs
 
NRIC NO: 1620089A
 
are charged that you, on 31 January 1997 at about 10.31pm at NTUC Fairprice, Blk 451 Clementi Avenue 3 #01-307, Singapore, being employed in the capacity of a servant, to wit, a groceries supervisor, did commit theft of ten cans of `New Moon` abalone, each valued at $32.80, with a total value of $328, in the possession of the manager, Tan Chin Chye, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 Section 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) states: 
Whoever being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to a fine.
 The appellant was convicted and sentenced to four weeks` imprisonment. She appealed against her conviction and sentence. I heard her appeal on 21 April 1998 and I allowed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 2.
 The case for the prosecution
The prosecution`s case was as follows. On the morning of 31 January 1997, Nancy Tee, a supervisor at the Clementi branch of NTUC Fairprice (NTUC), told Basuri bin Rosidi (Basuri), the security officer of NTUC, that there were some cans of abalone inside a Foster beer box under the appellant`s table in the office. Nancy Tee instructed Basuri to keep an eye on the abalone. During the day, Basuri went into the office at half-hourly or hourly intervals to check the box.
 3.Sometime after 6pm on 31 January 1997, Lee Swee Siong (Lee), a deaf mute storehand in the grocery department of NTUC, saw the appellant taking ten cans of abalone and two cans of shark`s fin. He identified the cans in exh P3, a photograph of the abalone cans, as the cans he saw. Lee saw the appellant place the cans in a Guinness box and move the box under the table. He then walked over to Goh Ah Keok (Goh), a supervisor of NTUC, to sign to her what was happening. At about 6.10pm, Goh saw the appellant put the cans of abalone into two Royal biscuits tins. The tins were those featured in exh P2, a photograph of the abalone cans in biscuit tins. The appellant sealed both tins with scotch tape. After sealing the tins, the appellant put them into her plastic bag.
 4.At 10.30pm that day, Basuri checked the appellant as she was leaving. She was carrying two plastic bags, each with a Royal biscuits tin in it. The appellant showed Basuri the receipt for the two tins of Royal biscuits. Basuri returned the receipt and the appellant left.
 5.Nancy Tee checked the Foster box with the abalone cans a total of four times that day. Sometime after 10pm, she checked the Foster box and discovered that the cans were missing. The abalone cans which were missing were of the type shown in P3. She then informed Basuri that the abalone cans were missing. After checking two people who were leaving, Basuri ran out to look for the appellant.
 6.Basuri found the appellant at Clementi Bus Interchange ten minutes later. He informed her that he needed to re-check her biscuit tins. She asked `Why`. He replied that a few cans of abalone were missing. She gave him one of the tins. He checked and found abalone cans inside. The appellant did not say anything. Basuri asked her to follow him back to the store. She initially refused but agreed when Basuri said she might be able to speak to the branch manager and he might give her a chance.
 7.Once back at the office, Basuri handed over the appellant and the biscuit tins to NT Lingam (Lingam), the security manager of NTUC. Basuri then called Tan Chin Chye (Tan), the manager of NTUC, to inform him about the matter. He also asked P Mohd s/o P Ahmad (Ahmad), the security supervisor of NTUC, to call the police.
 8.Inside the manager`s office, the abalone cans were taken out of the biscuit tins. The abalone cans Lingam and Tan saw were those shown in P3. Tan also confirmed that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour type of abalone similar to exh D4, an abalone can white and blue in colour.
 9.The appellant was escorted back to the station at about 11.23pm. The ten cans of abalone and two empty biscuit tins were seized as exhibits. These exhibits were subsequently handed over to Sergeant Tho Yeng Kok (Sgt Tho), the investigating officer. Sgt Tho asked Jumato bin Saad (Jumato) to photograph the exhibits. This resulted in exhs P2-P4. Sgt Tho returned the ten cans of abalone to Basuri on 3 February 1997. Sgt Tho proceeded to record the long statement from the appellant at about 1.10am on 2 February 1997. Woman Corporal Tan Siok Hoon was present at that recording. In the statement, the appellant admitted to the theft of the abalone cans.
 10.
 The case for the defence
The defence`s case was as follows. The appellant reported for work on 31 January 1997 at 2.24pm. Sometime after 5pm she left for dinner. She returned some time after 6pm. She bought her biscuit tins during her dinner break. According to the receipt they were bought at 6.35pm. She subsequently brought the biscuit tins back to the office and placed them under her table. Her evidence was that she could not remember whether there was anything underneath her table. She denied putting the abalone cans into the biscuit tins. She left work at 10.31pm.
 11.At Clementi bus interchange, Basuri stopped her, checked her biscuit tins and asked her to follow him back to the office. The appellant testified that the abalone cans that were taken out of the biscuit tins were blue and white cans similar to some specimens in court, D4. The appellant`s evidence was that abalone was one of the items under her charge and that abalone of the type similar to D4 was never sold in the supermarket. Only the type similar to another specimen D5, an abalone can chilli red in colour, and another specimen D2, an abalone can pink and blue in colour, were sold.
 12.The appellant denied stealing the abalone cans from NTUC. Her defence was that someone planted the cans in her biscuit tins to frame her.
 13.The appellant was not on good terms with some of the prosecution`s material witnesses, namely Lee, Basuri and Nancy Tee. Her relationship with Lee was poor because she had to scold him on occasions when he made mistakes. Her relationship with Basuri deteriorated after an argument over closing door shutters, and she had an argument with Nancy Tee over one of the appellant`s storehands.
 14.The appellant denied that her statement was made voluntarily. According to her, she was not allowed to visit the washroom during the three hour interview in the police station, even though she was suffering then from menstrual pains. She said that Sgt Tho threatened her with seven years` imprisonment and a fine if she did not sign the statement. Her evidence was that Sgt Tho offered to let her off with a warning and a fine if she signed the statement. She testified that she did not read the contents of the statement. After her release, she told her sister and brother-in-law about the incident. She testified that she attempted to contact Sgt Tho several times to correct what she signed but he refused to see her. She eventually made a police report on 8 May 1997, admitted as D6. A day before she was formally charged in court, she made a second police report.
 15.
 The magistrate`s findings
The appellant made several allegations of threats and inducement. The magistrate conducted a voir dire. After considering all the evidence, the magistrate was satisfied that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the statement had been given voluntarily and was not brought about by any threat, inducement or promise. The statement was admitted as PS2.
 16.One of the issues in contention was whether the abalone cans in question were those sold by NTUC. The actual cans had been returned to NTUC. The only evidence the prosecution had of the allegedly stolen cans were exhibit photographs P2 and P3. The defence`s contention was that the cans shown in P3 were white and blue, and that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour type of abalone cans. Tan and the appellant had testified that NTUC did not sell the white and blue type of abalone cans. In cross-examination, Jumato was referred to P2 and questioned as to the colour of the cans. He answered that they were white and blue and further confirmed that the cans in P2 were similar to the blue and white type of D4.
 17.The magistrate made a finding of fact that the cans of abalone in P2 and P3 were the pink and blue type sold by NTUC and not of the type similar to the blue and white D4.
 18.
 The appeal
The crux of the appeal was this. Were the abalone cans in question of the type sold by NTUC? The appellant and Tan, the manager of NTUC, had testified that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour abalone cans. They only sold the red cans, and the pink and blue cans. The only evidence the prosecution had regarding the allegedly stolen cans were photographs P2 and P3, the actual cans having been returned on 3 February 1997. In cross-examination, Jumato, the police photographer, testified that the cans in P2 and P3 were white and blue and confirmed that the cans in P2 were similar to those in D4. It was also conceded by the counsel for the prosecution that the cans in P2 and P3 appeared more white than pink. Examining P2 and P3, I was also of the opinion that the cans in P2 and P3 were white and blue in colour and not pink and blue.
 19.The prosecution submitted that the magistrate`s finding was supported by the appellant`s statement to the police, in which she admitted that the abalone seized from her belonged to the management of the supermarket. The prosecution also submitted that the magistrate`s finding that the abalone cans in P2 and P3 were sold by NTUC was reinforced by the fact that the appellant did not, at any stage before the trial, protest that the abalone seized from her did not belong to the supermarket. In effect the prosecution tried to prove that the abalone cans were in the possession of Tan, by relying on evidence from the appellant`s statement and on a single strand of circumstantial evidence arising from the appellant`s behaviour. I am of the view, however, that such evidence is contradicted by other evidence tendered by the prosecution themselves, namely the photographs P2 and P3 of white and blue abalone cans, the evidence of Jumato that the cans in P2 and P3 were white, and the evidence from Tan himself that NTUC did not sell the white and blue type of abalone cans.
 20.The totality of the evidence in this case was clearly that the cans in question in P2 and P3 were white and blue and of the type not sold by NTUC. In my judgment, the magistrate erred with respect to a material finding of fact when she found that the cans in P2 and P3 were the pink and blue type sold by NTUC.
 21.There was therefore no proof that the abalone cans were in the possession of Tan, the manager of NTUC. As a result the charge against the appellant was not made out. It is settled law that the test to be applied at the close of the prosecution`s case is that set out in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  [1980-1981] SLR 73 . At the end of the prosecution`s case the judge must consider whether 
 there is some evidence (not inherent incredible) which, if he were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding that `no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction `
 22.In this case, the prosecution failed to establish an essential element of the offence, in that they failed to establish that the abalone cans were in the possession of the appellant`s master. Accordingly the defence should not have been called.
 23.For these reasons, the appeal against conviction was allowed.","1998-04-29 00:00:00","SG High Court"

 2.
 Facts
The appellant was involved in an accident on 2 January 1996 at about 12am, at the junction of Yishun Avenues 5 and 2. He was in the process of negotiating a right turn into Yishun Avenue 2 from Yishun Avenue 5 when a motorcycle travelling along Yishun Avenue 2 collided into the rear left door of the appellant`s car. The appellant drove on without stopping. The motorcyclist and the pillion rider sustained fractured limbs and were taken to hospital.
 3.The accused was later arrested and his blood was found to contain 149mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood. He pleaded guilty to the following charges under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed): 
(a) Driving under the influence of drink under s 67(1); and 
(b) Failing to render assistance to persons injured in an accident under s 84(3).
 The following charges were taken into consideration: 
(a) Failing to stop a vehicle in an accident under s 84(1); and 
(b) Moving a vehicle involved in an accident under s 84(4).
 He was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and ten years` disqualification from driving and fined $800. On appeal to the High Court, the sentence of one month`s imprisonment was set aside and a fine of $5,000 was imposed.
 4.In March 1997, the witnesses to the accident were interviewed on the local television program `Code Red`. The matter was then referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) by the Television Corporation of Singapore.
 
 The prosecution`s case
Ng Geok Hock (PW1)
 5.Ng testified that he was driving his taxi along Yishun Avenue 5 when he witnessed the accident. After the appellant had completed the turn into Yishun Avenue 2, the appellant slowed down before picking up speed again and driving off. When Ng saw the appellant driving off, he followed the appellant`s car. The appellant turned into a side road with a no entry sign. Ng followed him. The appellant then turned right into the Yishun bus interchange. Ng flashed the headlights of his taxi and sounded his horn to try to get the appellant to stop. When the appellant was close to the exit of the interchange, Ng drove alongside the appellant`s car. The appellant then stopped. Ng parked his taxi in front of the appellant`s car to prevent him from driving off. Both drivers alighted from their vehicles.
 6.Ng asked the appellant in a mixture of English and Hokkien why he had `hit and run`. The appellant replied, `No` and said that he wanted to give Ng money to let him go. By this time, Ng had already called the police on his handphone and reported the matter. He therefore told the appellant that he had already called the police and was waiting for their arrival. Under cross-examination, he admitted that he could not remember the exact words of the conversation. But he was adamant that the appellant had offered him money to let him go and that this offer had been made two or three times. He was also adamant that the appellant had made the offer before he had told the appellant that he had already called the police.
 7.Ong (PW2) and Susan Goh (PW4) then arrived on the scene. He overheard part of the conversation between Susan Goh and the appellant. Susan Goh asked the appellant why he had not stopped after knocking somebody down and had instead run away. The appellant then offered her money if she let him go. Susan said that she did not want his money.
 Ong Siong San (PW2)
 8.Ong was driving his taxi along Yishun Avenue 5 when he witnessed the accident. He drove after the appellant`s car. He followed him into the side road with the no entry sign all the way into the interchange. He parked his taxi behind the appellant`s car. He saw the appellant and Ng talking but could not hear their conversation. He asked the appellant if he was trying to run away after knocking somebody down. The appellant replied that he did not know what had happened and that he was not trying to run away. Ong then asked him why he had ignored the no entry sign if he was not trying to run away. The appellant remained silent. Susan Goh then arrived. Ong then went back to the scene of the accident. When he returned to the interchange, he saw Ng and Susan Goh scolding the appellant. He heard them say that the appellant had knocked somebody down, failed to stop and was still trying to run away. He also heard them say, `Your money very big.` Susan Goh then told him that the appellant had offered them money to let him go. Ong became very angry and scolded the appellant for trying to escape after knocking down somebody. Ong also said, `Your money is so big. Two lives are involved.`
 9.Under cross-examination, Ong said that when they were scolding the appellant, his 
 impression 
 was that he told them to let him go. It was also his 
 impression 
 that Ng had already reported the matter to the police. Under further cross-examination, Ong said that the appellant 
 had 
asked them to let him go home. Ong later clarified this, saying that the appellant 
 had 
 pleaded with them to let him go. Under re-examination, Ong further claified this, saying that the appellant 
 was 
 trying to tell them to let him off. None of this was in Ong`s evidence-in-chief.
 10.At this point counsel for the defence applied to recall Ng so as to put to Ng that he, similarly, merely had an 
 impression 
 that the appellant was asking Ng to let him go. Counsel for the prosecution objected on the ground that Ng had already been cross-examined extensively on whether the appellant had asked Ng to let him go. The trial judge agreed and refused the application.
 Susan Goh Soon Bee (PW4)
 11.Susan Goh was in a car driven by her sister Goh Quek Bee (Goh) (PW3) when she witnessed the accident. When the appellant failed to stop, she ran after his car to try and record the appellant`s registration plate number. She arrived at the interchange to find the appellant talking to two taxi drivers, Ng and Ong. She said that one of the taxi drivers had asked the appellant why he had failed to stop after knocking down somebody. The appellant asked him not to report the matter to the police. The taxi driver said that the matter must be reported. The appellant then offered them money in return for not reporting the matter to the police. Under cross-examination, Susan Ong was adamant as to what the appellant had said as well as to the sequence of the conversation. The appellant had asked them not to report him to the police and that he would give them all money if they all let him go. The taxi driver had then told the appellant that he had already reported the matter.
 12.The appellant then spoke to Susan Goh alone and asked her to speak to the other taxi drivers on his behalf. He told her that he would give all of them money if they let him off. Under cross-examination, she was adamant that the offer of money had been made to all three of them and not to her alone, and that the appellant had gesticulated in the direction of the two taxi drivers when making the offer.
 Goh Guek Bee (PW3)
 13.Goh was driving her car with Susan Goh beside her when she witnessed the accident. Susan had got out and run after the appellant`s car. When Susan returned, she was very angry and told her how the appellant had offered them money to let him go and how the appellant had approached her to reason with the taxi drivers on his behalf.
 The appellant`s statements
 14.The appellant viewed a recording of the program `Code Red` before making a statement under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed). The material parts of the statement are as follows: 
3 On that night, after I realised that I hit an object at the junction of Yishun Ave 2 & 5, I turned to Yishun Bus Interchange and stop there. Soon I realised that there were two taxi drivers parked in front and back of my vehicle. They started scolding me for not stopping after hitting the motorcycle. Later, one lady join them. The lady was very angry and aggressive. At that moment, I thought that the lady was related to the motorcyclist. 
4 I was in a state of shock and panic after they told me that I had hit a motorcycle. I pleaded with them not to report to the police. I remember clearly that I told them to `talk about it` first before reporting to the police. What I meant was that if they demanded money I would give it to them. One of the taxi drivers told me that he had already reported to the police. In the process of pleading with them, I might have told them that I would offer them money if they could let me go. I did not remember how much I was going to give them to let me go. I cannot remember how actually I phrased the sentence. I was in the lost and I did not know what I was saying. 
5 I wish to say I do not normally behave that way. I was not in the right frame of mind after the accident. I was also very high at that time after consumption of alcohol.
 15.In his cautioned statements to the two charges, the appellant simply said that he would like to consult his lawyer.
 16.
 The defence
The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He testified that he had heard a thud sound coming from the rear of his car when he was turning right into Yishun Avenue 2. He slowed down momentarily and glanced at his rear view mirror and also took a half glance to the rear, but saw nothing. Nonetheless, he wanted to stop the car to see if any damage had been done to the car. He had turned into the side road so that he could stop the car. He had not seen the no entry sign. He was intending to stop the car when he saw a vehicle behind him flashing its headlights. He thought he was obstructing the vehicle and so he drove on. When the vehicle came alongside his car and sounded its horn, he immediately stopped the car and got out. The driver of the vehicle, whom he identified as Ng, also alighted.
 17.Ng asked him why he had not stopped after hitting a motorcycle. The appellant was shocked at the accusation as he had not realised he had hit a motorcycle. But Ng insisted that he had done so and that he had reported the matter to the police. The appellant asked Ng why he had reported the matter to the police when the appellant had not seen any such accident. If indeed there was such an accident, he should go and render assistance. However, Ng insisted that he stay put.
 18.Another vehicle then drew up behind his car. The driver, whom he identified as Ong, alighted and accused the appellant of running away after hitting a motorcycle. There followed a stream of such accusations from Ng and Ong.
 19.He next heard a woman, whom he identified as Susan Goh, screaming loudly and gesticulating wildly. He thought that she was one of the accident victims. He apologised to her and offered her money as compensation. He was however not sure whether he had actually used the word `compensation`. He asked her how much she needed. He also told her not to call the police as he thought that it was only a minor accident. Susan Goh was very angry and rejected his offer, saying, `You think your money so big.`
 20.The appellant then realised that Susan might not be one of the victims of the accident. The appellant claimed that one of the prosecution witnesses had mentioned that two people had been injured in the accident. He then asked Susan Goh to discuss with `them` how much they wanted. He explained that by `them`, he meant the accident victims, and he had emphasised this by gesticulating towards the scene of the accident.
 21.As regards his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the appellant claimed that at the time the statement was recorded, he had been unable to recall what had happened at the bus interchange. When asked by his counsel why he had stated `in the process of pleading, I might have told them that I would offer them money if they could let me go`, he said that the witnesses had been very convincing on the program `Code Red` when they accused him of offering them money to let him go, so much so that he had begun to doubt himself. As such, he had taken a conciliatory stance even though he did not believe that he would bribe anyone. However, once he had heard the witnesses give evidence during the trial that he had said, `Let me go, I give you money`, he stopped doubting himself and was convinced that he had not tried to bribe them. As for his cautioned statements, he said that he had been shocked and his first reaction was to consult a lawyer. He was also afraid that he would say the wrong things in his statements.
 22.
 Decision below
The trial judge examined the photographs of the damage done to the appellant`s car and found that the appellant must have been aware of the collision with the motorcycle. Further, the appellant`s conduct after the collision had taken place showed that he had been aware of the collision. The trial judge went on to weigh the evidence of the prosecution witnesses against that of the appellant. The trial judge noted that the appellant had conceded in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act that he might have made an offer of money in return for being let off. The trial judge also drew an adverse inference against the appellant for failing to mention the material particulars of his defence in his cautioned statements. In the result, the trial judge accepted the evidence of Ng, Ong and Susan Goh and disbelieved the appellant`s defence. The trial judge accordingly convicted the appellant on both charges and imposed a fine of $15,000 in respect of each charge.
 23.
 The appeal
The appellant appealed only against his convictions and not against his sentences. On appeal, counsel for the appellant raised the following issues: (a). the trial judge`s findings of fact;
 (b). her refusal to allow counsel for the defence to recall Ng;
 (c). the drawing of an adverse inference against the appellant under s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68); and
 . whether the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose.
 24.It is useful at this stage to reiterate the principles governing an appellate court`s role in reviewing the trial judge`s findings of fact. It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where they hinge on the trial judge`s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. This is borne out by s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which states that no judgment, sentence or order of a district court or magistrate`s court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case. In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , FA Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, held at p 719: 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 Similarly, in the case of 
Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , in which findings of fact depended on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, Lord Diplock, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, held that an appellate court should be reluctant to overturn findings made by the trial judge because they are in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full and observing their demeanour. The upshot of these cases is that factual findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence of good reasons. Then again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual findings which have been ascertained, a different approach will be taken. In such cases, it is again trite law that an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case. With these principles in mind, we turn to the appeal proper.
 25.
 Whether the appellant knew that he had been involved in an accident at the time the offer of money was made
The appellant`s first contention was that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had been aware of the accident and had attempted to run away from the scene of the accident.
 26.The trial judge relied heavily on (a) the damage to the appellant`s car and (b) the appellant`s behaviour immediately after the accident.
 27.The trial judge found that the damage to the rear door of the appellant`s car was so extensive that it was inconceivable that the appellant could have been unaware of the collision with the motorcycle. In response, the appellant contended that (a) his car was an extremely heavy vehicle, being a Mercedes S300, (b) the car radio was on and (c) he was intoxicated at the time and so the collision had not been apparent to him. He had merely heard a thud. After examining the photographs of the damage to the appellant`s car, I was of the view that the appellant must have been aware of the collision. The entire rear door had caved in, and judging by the fact that both the riders of the motorcycle had been flung off in the collision and suffered multiple fractures, the impact must have been substantial enough to capture the appellant`s attention. The appellant claimed in his evidence-in-chief that he had looked back and seen nothing. This was rejected by the trial judge and she was, in my view, fully justified in doing so.
 28.The trial judge also found that the appellant`s behaviour immediately after the collision showed that he was aware of the accident and was trying to run away. The appellant had driven into a side road despite the presence of a no entry sign and had continued driving into the Yishun bus interchange. He had driven to the end of the interchange and had only stopped when Ng drew alongside him in his taxi. The appellant explained in his evidence-in-chief that, having heard a thud, he had wanted to stop the car to check if his car had been damaged. He had not seen the no entry sign. The reason why he had stopped only when Ng had drawn alongside him was because Ng had been flashing his headlights at him and he thought he was obstructing Ng`s way. The appellant`s explanations were rejected by the trial judge. She found that the appellant`s actions were explicable only as those of a person trying to run from an accident scene. In particular, she noted that the appellant could not have been obstructing Ng`s way as the bus interchange was extremely wide with plenty of room to overtake. I agreed with the trial judge`s findings. The appellant`s actions were explicable only as those of a confused and panic-stricken person trying to run from the scene of an accident. If he had merely heard a thud, as he claimed he did, he must have thought that the damage, if any, to his car would be minor. Why then would he take the trouble to ignore a no entry sign and turn into a bus interchange to stop the car to check for damage?
 29.In any case, the essential element to be established was that the appellant knew that he had been involved in an accident 
 at the time 
 the alleged offer of money to the prosecution witnesses took place, the purpose of which was to induce the witnesses to let him go so that he could escape the consequences of being involved in the accident. Ng testified that he had accused the appellant of running away after colliding with a motorcycle 
 before 
 the offer of money had taken place. Ong had also levelled the same accusation at the appellant. The appellant claimed in his evidence-in-chief that he had not believed their accusations. Yet he had failed to take the simple step of checking his car for damage to satisfy himself that he had not been involved in such an accident. The appellant later said in his evidence-in-chief that he had initially thought that Susan Goh was of the victims of the accident. In other words, the appellant had come to accept that he had been involved in an accident with a motorcycle. Therefore, even if the appellant had not been aware of the accident before his encounter with Ng, Ong and Susan Go at the bus interchange, the appellant must nonetheless have been aware of the accident at the time the offer of money was made.
 30.
 Whether the appellant had offered a gratification to Ng
The trial judge found that Ng had consistently maintained that the appellant had offered him money to let him go and that the offer had been repeated two or three times. On the other hand, the trial judge found that the appellant had taken four inconsistent positions as to whether he had offered money to Ng.
 31.The appellant contended that the trial judge had erred in so finding. I was unable to accept the appellant`s contention. The appellant had first stated in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act that he might have made an offer of money. Later, he recanted and explained that he had been swayed by the witnesses` account of events on the program `Code Red` and that he was now sure that he had not made such an offer. When asked in cross-examination whether he had made an offer of money to Ng, the appellant said that he could not recall. Yet, under re-examination, when asked again whether he had made an offer of money to Ng, the appellant claimed that he had not done so. In my judgment, the trial judge was fully justified in finding that the appellant`s answers were inconsistent and unsatisfactory.
 32.The appellant next contended that the trial judge had attached insufficient weight to the inconsistencies in Ng`s evidence. In particular, during Ng`s examination-in-chief, he had stated that the appellant had replied, `No` when he had accused him of running away after knocking down a motorcycle, whereas under cross-examination he had said that he could not recall if the appellant had denied being involved in the accident. The short answer to this is that the discrepancy was an immaterial one which did not detract from the general veracity of Ng`s evidence. The trial judge was perfectly entitled to treat the discrepancy as trivial and to ignore it: 
Chean Siong Guan v PP
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
 . As this court noted in 
PP v Kalpanath Singh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
  at p 579: 
Adequate allowance must be accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection. It is also common to find varying accounts of the same incident by the same person. No one can describe the same thing exactly over and over again.
 33.The appellant next contended that when he had asked Ng to let him go, he had only wanted to be allowed to go the scene of the accident. The trial judge had rejected the appellant`s construction of the words `let me go`. She noted that the evidence of Ng and Susan Goh that the appellant had not asked to return to the scene of the accident was unchallenged. In fact, Susan Goh had asked the appellant to return to the scene of the accident, only to be told by the appellant that there was no need to do so as the accident was not a serious one. The appellant claimed to have used the words `let me go to render assistance`. However, none of the other witnesses testified that they had heard him use the words `render assistance`, and this was never put to them in cross-examination. In my view, the trial judge was fully justified in rejecting the appellant`s construction of the words `let me go`. If the appellant had truly wanted to return to the scene of the accident, he could have made his intentions much clearer and asked Ng or any of the other witnesses to accompany him back to the scene of the accident.
 34.
 Whether the trial judge erred in refusing to recall Ng
The appellant next contended that the trial judge should have allowed the defence to recall Ng so that he could be cross-examined as to whether his evidence was that the appellant had 
 in fact 
 offered him money, or was it merely his 
 impression 
 that the appellant had offered him money. The trial judge refused the application on the ground that Ng had already been extensively cross-examined on the issue and had maintained throughout that the appellant had in fact offered him money.
 35.The court has a discretionary power to recall a witness if the evidence of the witness appears to the court essential to the just decision of the case: s 399 Criminal Procedure Code. In my judgment, the trial judge exercised her discretion correctly in refusing to recall Ng. Ng had already been cross-examined repeatedly on the issue in question and maintained throughout that the appellant had in fact offered him money. It would be fruitless to recall him only for him to give the same evidence all over again. Ng would in effect be simply re-stating his evidence, and this has been held to be highly irregular and recognised as a valid ground for refusing to recall a witness:

 Whether the appellant had offered a gratification to Susan Goh
Susan Goh testified that the appellant had offered money to Ng, Ong and herself to let him go and not report the matter to the police. She also testified that the appellant had later approached her and asked her to speak to the other taxi drivers. He told her that he would give all of them money if they let him off. Under cross-examination, she was adamant that the offer of money had been made to all three of them and not to her alone, and that the appellant had gesticulated in the direction of the two taxi drivers when making the offer. The appellant on the other hand claimed that he had thought that Susan Goh was one of the victims of the accident and he had therefore offered money to her as compensation. When he realised that she was not in fact one of the victims, he had approached her to negotiate with the accident victims on his behalf, and had gesticulated in the direction of the accident scene to emphasise his point.
 37.The trial judge rejected the appellant`s version of events. I found that the trial judge was perfectly justified in doing so. If the appellant had truly thought that Susan Goh was one of the accident victims, one would have thought that he would be extremely apologetic and would ask about her condition and if anyone else was hurt. Yet the appellant had failed to do so. As for the appellant asking Susan Goh to negotiate on his behalf, it seems to me incredible that the appellant should ask a complete stranger who was obviously hostile towards him to negotiate on his behalf. Moreover, at this point in time, he had no inkling as to the seriousness of the accident and the extent of the injuries suffered by the accident victims. It would have made far more sense for him to ask the witnesses to accompany him to the scene of the accident so that he could assess the situation and deal directly with the victims. Further, he had not mentioned this aspect of his defence in his cautioned statements or in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The trial judge was perfectly entitled to draw an adverse inference against the appellant for his failure to mention these facts.
 38.
 Whether an adverse inference should have been drawn under s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code
The appellant contended that the trial judge should not have drawn an adverse inference from his failure to raise the material aspects of his defence in his cautioned statements. His explanation was that he had wished to consult a lawyer first and did not want to say the `wrong things`. I found this explanation to be completely unacceptable. The whole purpose of s 123 is to compel the accused to outline the main aspects of his defence immediately upon being charged so as to guard against the accused raising defences at trial which are merely afterthoughts. If the accused is allowed to escape the consequences of s 123 simply by explaining that he had wished to consult a lawyer first before saying anything, s 123 would be rendered otiose. I would emphasise at this point that it is not in every case that an adverse inference is drawn against an accused who keeps silent upon being charged. An adverse inference will be drawn only if he fails to mention facts which he could reasonably have been expected to mention upon being charged. In the instant case, the appellant had failed to mention in his cautioned statement that he had thought Susan Goh was one of the victims of the accident, that he had offered her compensation and that he had later asked her to negotiate with the victims of the accident on his behalf. It must have been evident to the appellant, even without the benefit of consultation with a lawyer, that these facts afforded a legitimate explanation for the offers of money he allegedly made, and that it would be in his interest to mention them. These were thus facts which the appellant could reasonably have been expected to mention upon being charged, and the trial judge was perfectly entitled to draw an adverse inference against the appellant under s 123 for failing to mention these material aspects of his defence in his cautioned statements.
 39.
 Language barrier
The appellant contended that he had spoken to the prosecution witnesses in a mixture of Hokkien and English and that he might have been misunderstood as he was not fluent in Hokkien. However, the appellant had himself conceded under cross-examination that he did not think the prosecution witnesses had misunderstood him. The prosecution witnesses were adamant as to what the appellant had said to them, and it was never put to them in cross-examination that they might have misunderstood the appellant because of linguistic difficulties. The trial judge was fully justified in finding that there had been no misunderstanding despite the appellant`s lack of proficiency in Hokkien.
 40.
 Whether the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose
Finally, the appellant contended that the offer of money was not for a corrupt purpose within the meaning given to offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. I found this contention to be utterly without merit. It is well established that the word `corruptly` inserted within s 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act qualifies the offence in a significant manner. There must be a corrupt element in the transaction itself, and the offer of the gratification must be accompanied by a corrupt intent: 
PP v Khoo Yong Hak
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 283
 . As to the first limb, whether a transaction had a corrupt element is an objective inquiry based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. This question is to be answered only after the court has inferred what the accused intended when he entered into the transaction. In determining whether the transaction had a corrupt element according to the ordinary and objective standard, it is useful to keep in view the natural and ordinary meaning of the word `corrupt` as a working guide, albeit with the qualification that this is not exhaustive: 
Chan Wing Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 426
 . For present purposes, it suffices to note that one of the meanings of `corrupt` as defined in 
 The Oxford English Dictionary 
 is: 
To destroy or pervert the integrity or fidelity of (a person) in his discharge of duty; to induce to act dishonestly or unfaithfully; to make venal; to bribe.
 41.In the instant case, the appellant had intended to escape criminal liability in exchange for money. Such a transaction is clearly corrupt based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. Firstly, it is in substance a transaction in the nature of a bribe. Secondly, it is akin to an attempt to subvert the course of justice; the appellant clearly believed that he could bargain with the witnesses to his criminal acts and buy their co-operation if he was willing to pay the right price. In short, the appellant had sought to attach a monetary value to the witnesses` integrity and sense of justice. For these reasons, I had no hesitation in finding that the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose.

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant, a corporation, was convicted after a trial for carrying on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent for British United Provident Association Ltd (BUPA), which was an insurer not registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, an offence under s 33(1) Insurance Act (Cap 142, 1994 Ed). It was fined a total of $22,000. The appellant appealed against the conviction and sentence. The only issues on appeal were: (1) whether the appellant was acting as an insurance agent carrying on insurance business in Singapore for BUPA; and (2) whether the prohibition in s 33(1) Insurance Act is only limited to policies relating to risks in Singapore. After hearing the submissions, I dismissed the appeal and now set out my grounds.
 2.The charge was as follows: 
You, International Testing Co Pte Ltd Registration no: 199404857Z are charged that you, between October 1994 and March 1996, without the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, did carry on insurance business in Singapore as insurance agent for British United Provident Association Ltd, which was an insurer not entitled to carry on insurance business in Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 33(1) of the Insurance Act (Cap 142, 1994 Ed).
 3.
 The facts
The facts were simple and were agreed by the appellant. The whole of the prosecution case rested on the agreed facts. The appellant is a private limited company engaged in the business of consultant engineering services and general insurance. BUPA is an insurer based in the United Kingdom which offers health care insurance coverage. At the material times, BUPA was not registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore under s 3 of the Insurance Act, and it was prohibited from carrying on any class of insurance business in Singapore. At the material times, Rosaline Margaret Yap Gim Leng (Rosaline Yap) and John William Wilson were the directors and shareholders of the appellant. Rosaline Yap was in charge of the general insurance business division in the company.
 4.Between October 1994 and March 1996, the appellant arranged for BUPA policies to be issued to: (1) PT Comismar Wanamaja (Comismar), a company incorporated in Indonesia; (2) David Quodling (Quodling), an Australian based in Malaysia.
 5.
 Comismar
In a letter dated 24 August 1994, the appellant informed BUPA that it was organising the health care insurance of the management and consultancy personnel of Comismar and conveyed information on Comismar. On 26 August 1994, BUPA replied and it was followed by an exchange of correspondence between BUPA and the appellant. On 3 October 1994, the appellant sent a letter to BUPA, enclosing the agreement duly signed by BUPA and the duly completed enrolment forms of five employees of Comismar. BUPA acknowledged receipt of the forms.
 6.
 Quodling
On 31 October 1995, the appellant, at the request of Quodling, sent to him literature on health insurance plans offered by BUPA and ProMedico, an insurer, and the application forms for both insurers. In the letter, the appellant asked Quodling to return the application form duly completed so that the application `could be handled and approval sought from the respective underwriters`. On 15 December 1995, the appellant forwarded to BUPA the application form completed by Quodling and the premium paid by Quodling. On 9 January 1996, the appellant informed Quodling that his application to BUPA had been accepted. The appellant further informed Quodling that the insurance cover had commenced on 1 January 1996 and that relevant documents would be despatched to him once the appellant received them. Subsequently the appellant received the membership certificate issued by BUPA for Quodling and in turn sent the certificate to Quodling.
 7.
 The defence
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the defence counsel argued that there was no case to answer. Section 33(1) of the Insurance Act only covered `Singapore policies` under First Schedule para 2(1) or offshore polices issued in Singapore under para 2(2), read with s 2(5) of the Act. The policies in respect of which the appellant was charged were policies issued by foreign issuers not in Singapore. Alternatively, even if s 33(1) applied to the insurance policies in question, the appellant had not committed any offence as it had not carried on insurance business as an agent for an insurer; it had not received proposals for polices, issued policies or received premiums on policies under s 2(5). It merely acted as a post-box to transmit information from BUPA. The district judge rejected the defence submission of no case to answer. He called upon the appellant to enter its defence. The appellant elected not to give evidence. The district judge convicted the appellant on the grounds that the appellant did in fact carry on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent under s 2(5). Further s 33(1) was not restricted only to `Singapore policies`.
 
 The appeal
Whether the appellant was acting as an insurance agent for BUPA within s 33(1) Insurance Act
 8.Section 33(1) prohibits the carrying on by insurance agents of insurance business in Singapore for an insurer not registered with MAS. BUPA, in response to queries from the Commercial Affairs Department in its investigations against the appellant, replied that the appellant `did not operate as a tied agent for BUPA International in Singapore but as an independent intermediary`. Counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant was not acting as an insurance agent for BUPA but as a postbox. I paid very little regard to BUPA`s claims that the appellant was not an insurance agent acting on its behalf. Rather the court should examine whether, having regard to the policy behind legislation and the course of conduct of the appellant, it was acting as an insurance agent within the meaning of s 33(1) read with s 2(5).
 9.The policy behind the Act is to regulate and supervise the conduct of insurance business in Singapore. The Act draws a distinction between an insurance agent and an insurance broker: see ss 2(5) and 33. However, the definition in s 2(5) is unhelpful as it merely provides that a Singapore insurance broker means a person who is or has been carrying on business as an insurance broker in Singapore. Section 33(2) provides inter alia that a Singapore insurance broker shall only negotiate a contract of insurance with a Singapore insurer acting in the course of his business as such; the penalty for violating this provision is a maximum fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding a year.
 10.In my view, an insurance agent in s 2(5) is one who is acting as an agent of the insurer in negotiating, servicing or effecting insurance contracts whilst an insurance broker is an intermediary who is independent of any one insurer, and is generally an agent of the insured. In insurance law, the term insurance broker is understood to be one who is independent of and does not act for a designated insurer: Lewis E Davids, 
 Dictionary of Insurance 
, p 11 and 38; Clarke, 
 Law of Insurance Contracts 
 (3rd Ed, 1997) p 189. This is fortified by an examination of s 33. A heavier penalty is provided for an insurance agent carrying on business for an unauthorised insurer than for an insurance broker who negotiates a contract with an unauthorised insurer. An insurance agent within s 2(5) is one that acts on behalf of the insurer and is perceived by the legislature as being more culpable. Of course this does not mean that an insurance agent necessarily acts on the insurer`s behalf the whole of the time and he may in limited circumstances also act for the insured. In such a case, he will still be considered to be acting as an insurance agent under s 2(5). To hold otherwise would make the provisions of the regulatory legislation unworkable.
 11.Counsel argued that, since the appellant sent insurance brochures to Quodling of insurance proposals relating not only to BUPA but also to another insurer named ProMedico, the appellant was acting on behalf of Quodling. This was an untenable argument. The appellant did not hold itself out to act in the insured`s interest as would be expected of a broker acting on behalf of the insured in negotiating insurance contracts. There was no reason why the appellant could not be acting as an insurance agent for both BUPA and another insurer.
 12.In my view, the correspondence in the exhibits showed that the appellant was acting as an agent of the insurer. On the facts it was likely that the people carrying on business for the appellant company had no idea whether it was acting as an agent or as a broker when it was conducting business for clients, but, as I have pointed out earlier, the court had to determine whether the course of conduct undertaken by the appellant showed that it was acting as an agent or as a broker. The appellant did not hold himself out as an insurance broker when it was doing business and it was not registered as an insurance broker. The commission was paid by BUPA to the appellant at a rate of 10% on the introduction of new business and 10% on its renewal, not by the proposed insured. The appellant had authority from BUPA to receive proposals and forward them to BUPA for approval, and to communicate the explanation of the various terms found in the proposals to the proposed insured. In these circumstances, there was no doubt that the appellant was an insurance agent acting for BUPA.
 Scope of s 33(1) read with s 2(5) - Is the prohibition in s 33 read with s 2(5) confined to Singapore policies only?
 13.For ease of convenience, I set out the relevant provisions: 
33(1) No person shall, without the approval of the Authority
 , carry on insurance business in Singapore 
 as insurance agent for an insurer not entitled under this Act to carry on the business in question in Singapore; and a person contravening this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000 increased by a sum not exceeding $1,000 for every day on which he is proved to have done so, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. 
2(5) For the purpose of this Act, `Singapore insurer` and `Singapore insurance agent` mean a person who is or has been carrying on insurance business in Singapore as insurer and as insurance agent respectively, and `Singapore insurance broker` means a person who is or has been carrying on business as insurance broker in Singapore; and 
 references to carrying on insurance, or any class of insurance business, in Singapore include but include only the receipt of proposals for, or issuing of, policies in Singapore or the collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance polices 
.
 
First Schedule - Definition of Insurance Terms
 
2(1) Subject to this paragraph and section 15(30 and (4) of the Act, `Singapore policy`, in relation to any insurer, means a policy issued in the 
 course of the insurer`s business in Singapore and 
falling within one of the following descriptions:
 
(a) a life policy or personal accident policy in the case of which, at the date of issue of the policy and (if the policy was issued before then) at the date of the establishment of the insurer`s register of Singapore policies, the policy owner`s address is or was an address in Singapore; 
(b) in relation to direct general insurance (other than personal accident policies) and facultative general reinsurance, a policy in the case of which the risk arises in Singapore or where the insured is a person resident in Singapore or is a permanent establishment in Singapore; and 
 
 
(2) `Offshore policy`, in relation to any insurer, means any policy other than a Singapore policy, issued in the course of the insurer`s business in Singapore.
 14.The prosecution argued that s 2(5) read with s 33 are not confined only to Singapore policies but cover all offshore insurance policies as well. Counsel for the appellant argued that the provisions must be read with para 2 First Schedule which defines `Singapore policy` and `offshore policy`. The two policies in question were not `Singapore policies` as the insured were not persons with a address in Singapore or resident in Singapore or were a permanent establishment in Singapore or in respect of risks that arose in Singapore. He argued that BUPA did not issue Singapore policies nor cause offshore policies to be issued in Singapore; the policies were UK policies issued in the UK.
 15.I now address the first argument that s 33 is limited only to Singapore policies. This argument is clearly without any merit. Section 2(8) provides that the definitions set out in the First Schedule shall have effect for the construction of references to policies of insurance, policy owners and policy moneys. However on the plain reading of s 2(5), there is nothing which indicates that it applies only to Singapore policies. The First Schedule defines `Singapore policy` and `offshore policy` but these terms are not found in s 2(5) nor in s 33. I am unable to see how reference to the First Schedule provides any assistance. The three categories in s 2(5) refer to receipt of proposals for issuing of policies in Singapore or the collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on `
 insurance policies 
`, and not only Singapore policies. There is no reason why the definitions in para 2 of the First Schedule should apply to s 2(5) or s 33.
 16.Also, as the district judge pointed out, it is anomalous to read a limitation to s 33. Under s 15(1) read with the First Schedule, a registered person or body has to keep a register of all `Singapore policies` and offshore policies issued in Singapore, both of which have to be issued in Singapore. It cannot be that on one hand a registered and authorised insurer has to keep registers of both Singapore and offshore policies and yet, on another hand, one can carry on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent with respect to offshore (but not Singapore) policies for an unauthorised user. It must be that the prohibition extends to carrying on insurance business with respect to all policies as insurance agent for all unauthorised and unregistered insurers.
 17.Counsel for the appellant had relied on the Preamble which provided that the Act was enacted to regulate insurance business in Singapore, and it could not have been intended to regulate foreign policies. With respect, the Preamble is inconclusive. There is nothing anomalous about the plain reading of ss 2(5) and 33. The Act does not regulate the carrying on of all insurance business, only the carrying on of insurance business 
 in Singapore as defined in s 2(5) 
.
 18.I am fortified by an examination of the legislative history. In 1986, s 2(5) was amended by deleting the words `Singapore policies` to replace them with the words `insurance policies`. It is clear that `insurance policies` in s 2(5) must refer to all insurance policies and not only to Singapore policies as defined in the First Schedule.
 19.The second argument raised by counsel was that even if s 33 covered offshore policies, the insurance policies were issued in the UK, and did not fall within s 2(5). I shall first consider the policy in relation to Quodling. This turns on the interpretation of the word `issuing` in s 2(5). `Policy` is defined in para 1 of the First Schedule to the Act, as including any contract of insurance whether or not embodied in or evidenced by an instrument in the form of a policy.
 20.`Issue` is not defined in the Act. The prosecution relied on 
Koon Wing Lau v Calwell
 
[1949] 
80 CLR 533
 which held that `to issue` meant that the document had to pass from the possession of the authorities either into his manual custody or under his control or into his legal possession so as to be at his command. The district judge accepted the interpretation that, for the insurance policy to be issued to a person, there had to be physical delivery of the document into the custody of the recipient or under his control.
 21.
 Koon Wing Lau v Calwell 
 was dealing with a case under the amended Australian Immigration Act 1949. The Act provided that a certificate of exemption `issued` by an authorised officer, to a prohibited immigrant or an immigrant required to pass a dictation test within a certain period, was deemed to be valid. When such a certificate was issued, he was not subject to provisions of the Act restricting entry into or stay in Australia. The importance of the certificate of exemption was that, if the certificate expired or was subsequently cancelled (on the stipulated grounds), he would be declared a prohibited immigrant and might be deported. The High Court of Australia held that the certificate was only `issued` within the 1949 Act if the certificate was delivered to the person named in the certificate. In that case, the High Court of Australia was dealing with the status of immigration of persons who could be deported. There was no doubt that, on such matters affecting his right to stay in Australia, the immigrant had to be informed as to whether he was allowed to remain in Australia. If the certificate was only signed by the authorities informing the immigrant and the certificate subsequently expired, he was liable to be deported. Hence it was justifiable to hold that the certificate had to be delivered to the immigrant.
 22.Here, we were concerned with a very different matter, viz. the issuing of insurance policies. The meaning of `issuing` in s 2(5) has to be construed not in the abstract but with reference to the use of the term in insurance law. An insurance contract is concluded when the duly completed proposal form is accepted by the insurers. Acceptance has to be communicated to the insured party. However, intimation by the insurer that the insured`s offer has been accepted can be in the form of the issuance of a policy to the insured: Tan Lee Meng, 
 Law of Insurance 
 (2nd Ed, 1997) at p 25. For the policy to be issued to the insured, there is no requirement that the policy must be both executed and delivered to the insured. Once the policy is executed to the insured, the policy is binding on both parties. This is illustrated in 
Roberts v Security Co Ltd
 
[1897] 1 QB 111
. In that case, a proposal for an insurance of goods against loss by burglary was made by the plaintiff to the defendant insurance company. The insurance company affixed the seal of the company to the policy which was in conformity to the proposal and the policy was duly signed. However, the policy remained in the hands of the insurance company and was not yet delivered when the loss occasioned by burglary occurred. The Court of Appeal held that the policy constituted a complete contract of insurance; the proposal was accepted when the policy was executed under the seal of the company.
 23.In this case, it was BUPA which had issued the policy of insurance to Quodling. The appellant sent a letter dated 9 January 1996 informing him that his application to BUPA had been accepted and the policy would be despatched to him once the appellant received it. This showed that it was BUPA which had executed the insurance policy in the United Kingdom and then delivered it to the appellant as agent in Singapore. By executing the policy, the policy was `issued` in the United Kingdom. The delivery of the policy was not necessary to constitute `issuing` within s 2(5). As such I disagreed with the district judge who found that the policy to Quodling was issued by the appellant in Singapore.
 24.However, the prohibition in s 2(5) is not confined only to the issuing of insurance policies in Singapore. There are two other categories in s 2(5): (1) receipt of proposals for policies in Singapore and (2) collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance policies.
 25.There was no doubt that the proposal for the insurance policy was received in Singapore. `Proposal` is not defined in the Act. The district judge accepted the meaning as, where there was a proposal form issued by the insurer, the proposal was the form which had been duly completed by the insured; and where there was no proposal form, the proposal was a document which could be construed as an offer made by the proposed insured to the insurer which, if accepted by the insurer, constituted a binding contract between the proposed insured and the insurer. I agreed with this interpretation of the word `proposal`.
 26.On 31 October 1995. Quodling received a BUPA application form from the appellant to be duly completed by himself. The appellant asked Quodling to return to it the completed forms so that they `may be handled and approval sought from the respective underwriters`. On an examination of the application form, it was indeed a proposal form which, when duly filled in and signed by the proposed assured and forwarded to the insurers, would operate as a formal offer by the proposed assured to the insurers. The duly completed form was received by the appellant who then forwarded it to BUPA on 15 December 1995. There was no doubt that the appellant had authority from BUPA to receive the proposal from the proposed insured, though it might not have authority to enter into the insurance contract on BUPA`s behalf. Hence there was receipt by the appellant on behalf of BUPA.
 27.It was doubtful whether there was receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance policies. The appellant forwarded the duly completed application form together with 
 a bank draft drawn in pounds made in BUPA`s favour 
 for the first premium. Counsel for the defence argued that there was no receipt of moneys in Singapore as the premium took the form of a bank draft made to BUPA`s order for onward transmission. Receipt of the premiums only took place when the bank draft made in BUPA`s favour was delivered to BUPA. The appellant did not receive the premiums in Singapore. The appellant had authority to receive the bank draft and to transmit it to BUPA but it was essentially acting only as a conduit in this respect. Hence I found that there was no receipt of premiums in Singapore.
 28.In relation to Comismar, there was receipt by the appellant of BUPA`s proposal in Singapore. The agreement was signed on 13 September 1994 and it was sent to the appellant. On 3 October 1994, the appellant sent to BUPA a letter enclosing an agreement duly signed by both Comismar and BUPA and the duly completed enrolment forms of five employees of Comismar. The insurance agreement was contained in the agreement duly signed by both parties.
 29.The result was that the conviction of the appellant should be upheld, but not on all the grounds relied on by the district judge. I found that the offence under s 33(1) of the Act was contravened on two occasions; the first was when the proposal for the insurance policy in relation to Quodling was received in Singapore on 15 December 1995 and the second was when the proposal for the insurance policy in relation to Comismar was received in Singapore on 3 October 1994. Both proposals were received by the appellant as BUPA`s agent for onward transmission to BUPA.
 30.
 Sentence
The offence under s 33(1) of the Act is punishable with up to $20,000 fine increased by up to $1,000 for every day on which the offender is proved to have continued the offence, or up to two years imprisonment or to both. The district judge sentenced the appellant to an $18,000 fine, increased by a sum of $1,000 for every day of the four days it contravened s 33(1). With respect, I was of the view that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The appellant had contravened s 33(1) in relation only to two insurance policies relating to two different clients. The offence stretched from October 1994 to March 1996 but the appellant`s carrying on insurance business in Singapore was limited only to receiving proposals from the proposed insured and forwarding them to BUPA. The insured`s interest was not shown to be affected nor was the operation over such a prolonged period. It was not carrying on a large scale insurance business for BUPA. It was the appellant`s first conviction. I accepted that the appellant did not know that its manner of carrying on business contravened s 33. The public interest was not adversely affected. In the circumstances the fine should be reduced to $10,000. Given my earlier finding that the offence was committed only on the receipt of Quodling`s proposal in Singapore, as well as the receipt of Comismar`s proposals in Singapore, the contravention of s 33(1) took place only on two occasions, as opposed to the four occasions found by the district judge. Accordingly the sentence was reduced to a $10,000 fine increased by a sum of $1,000 for each of the two days the appellant violated s 33(1), making a total sentence of $12,000. The appeal against the sentence was allowed to this extent.","1998-07-21 00:00:00","SG High Court"

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This appeal is against conviction and sentence of six months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for a conviction of an offence under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65).
 2.
 The charge
The appellant was charged with possession of an offensive weapon as follows: 
You, Lee Cher Chiang, NRIC/PP No S7703059-Z are charged that you, on or about 6 June 1997, at or about 11.20pm, at Blk 3 Geylang Serai, Singapore, which is a public place did have in your possession an offensive weapon, to wit, a knife with a blade measuring 30cm, otherwise than with lawful authority or for lawful purpose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65).
 3.
 The facts
On the 6 June 1997 at about 11.33pm a police message was received by the Geylang Police Station from their Division Operation Room to attend to a case of four or five people, race unknown, fighting at the void deck of Blk 2 Geylang Serai, and running towards Joo Chiat carrying some sticks. Two police constables, Loo Chin Huat (Loo) and Ahmad Zaki bin Samsuri (Ahmad) went to the scene and saw four men at the ground floor of Blk 3 Geylang Serai. Two of the men were holding a stick each while the third man had a knife and the last a parang. Upon seeing the policemen, three of the men threw down their weapons and ran away. The fourth man placed his parang on the ground and tried to walk away. When Loo and Ahmad shouted at him to stop, he stopped and surrendered himself. They arrested him and seized the two sticks, parang and knife. This man was later identified as Sie Kok Choon (Sie).
 4.A while later, another patrol car (CR 13 ) and a group of plain-clothes Voluntary Special Constabulary (VSC) came to their assistance. One of the crew members from CR 13 found a bag about 10m away at the grass verge near the main road which contained yet another knife. The VSC came back about 15 to 30 minutes later with three male Chinese. These three men were the appellant, Sie Kok Chye (Kok Chye) and Vincent Ang Choon Keong (Vincent). Loo and Ahmad were unable to identify any of these three men as the ones who had fled as their backs were turned when they did so. Furthermore, Loo and Ahmad were still in the patrol car at that time. However, they could see that the person who threw down the knife was a male Chinese.
 5.Loo also testified that the scene was brightly lit by the corridor lights of the Housing and Development Board flats where the shops were. He did not chase after the three men who had fled because their back-up had not arrived then. In addition, as Sie was not yet handcuffed at that time, he could not leave his partner, Ahmad, to handle Sie alone.
 6.
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution led evidence from Sie that he, together with Lucas Lim Chong Lin (Lucas), Vincent and the appellant had a fight with some other people earlier on the night of 6 June 1997. Sie testified that he then went home at Blk 11 Haig Road and put two knives and a parang into a bag while the rest waited at the ground floor below. He said that he had told them that he wanted to get a knife. They then went to Blk 3 Geylang Serai where he took the parang from the bag while the appellant took the knife. He was together with the appellant at that time but did not notice where the other two went. They then walked to the back entrance of the coffee shop at Blk 3 Geylang Serai with the appellant ahead of him. While they were still in the corridor, he saw the appellant suddenly place the knife on the floor and walk away very fast. He next saw the police car arrive and a policeman shouted at him. He was then arrested. He had only known the appellant for a year and had never had any quarrel with him.
 7.During cross-examination Sie corrected himself. He said that it was actually only Lucas who was involved in the earlier fight. When Lucas came to tell him about it later, Vincent and the appellant were present. His explanation for this contradiction with the evidence in his examination-in-chief was that he did not want to mention Lucas`s name as he had not been arrested. He said that Lucas told him that there were seven to eight persons in the other group comprising Malays and Chinese who assaulted him and there were wounds on Lucas`s head. After Lucas complained to him, he told those present, including the appellant, that he would go home to get knives.
 8.He also said that his brother Kok Chye was not present at that time. He had only met him at home and he did not see him packing the knives or go with him to Geylang Serai. However, when asked by his brother, Sie did tell him that he was going to Geylang Serai.
 9.Kok Chye`s evidence was that when he went home on the night in question, he saw the appellant, Vincent and Lucas at his void deck. Lucas, who was bleeding from his head told him that he had been assaulted. He then told Lucas that he would talk to the group and asked them to wait for him while he went home to change first. When he reached home, he saw Sie carrying a bag. He did not know what was in the bag. When he asked Sie what the problem was, he said that it was a quarrel and left. By the time he went downstairs, Sie and the rest were gone. He then went to the coffee shop at Blk 3 Geylang Serai. There he met a friend of his, one `Ah Hock`, who worked as a helper at the coffeeshop but there was no sign of Sie, the appellant or any of the others. He asked Ah Hock about the fight earlier and Ah Hock pointed out a group of male Malays and Chinese sitting at a table where the fight had taken place earlier. When he approached them, they smashed a beer bottle. He told them to remain calm and chided them for assaulting a small boy like Lucas. They replied that it was Lucas who assaulted them first and they were only retaliating. Kok Chye then demanded that they return the bicycle which they had taken from Lucas. They then threw the key of the bicycle to him and told him to collect it in the back lane. Later, he saw Lucas and handed the key to him. He told Lucas to collect his bicycle and return home to attend to his head injuries. Lucas then left.
 10.Subsequently two uniformed policemen arrived at the coffeeshop and approached the group of Malays. He could not hear their conversation. The policemen then approached him and asked him if he was aware that there had been a fight. He replied in the negative. On the advice of the policemen, Kok Chye left the premises. On his way home, he saw Vincent and the appellant near the coffee shop at the traffic light near Geylang Serai and walked with them. Along Joo Chiat Road, he was stopped by a police car and four plain-clothes policemen searched him and brought him back to the coffeeshop at Blk 3 Geylang Serai. The plain-clothes policemen asked the two uniformed policemen present whether he was the culprit and they replied in the negative.
 11.
 The defence
The appellant`s version of the events on the night of 6 June 1997 was essentially that he was never in possession of the knife. He testified that on the night in question he, along with Vincent and Kok Chye, was with Sie and three or four other persons whom he did not know. Sie told him that he had some matter at Geylang Serai and `pestered` him to go with him. Sie stopped off at home first and returned with the bag. Sie then took out a knife from the bag. The appellant was very surprised and turned and left.
 12.On cross-examination, the appellant said that when he was with Sie, Vincent and Kok Chye, Lucas approached Sie and spoke to him alone. Sie then told them that there was some matter at Geylang Serai and asked them to follow him. They stopped at his house first. When he came down he was carrying a bag. He showed them a knife from the bag on the way to Blk 3 and the three of them walked away. Along the way to Blk 3 they had met three or four of Sie`s friends. He was later checked by the police with Kok Chye and Vincent.
 13.Clearly the case for the defence was that it was Sie`s other three or four friends who were seen by Loo and Ahmad to be in possession of the knife and not the appellant.
 14.
 The trial judge`s decision
The trial judge below stated that the issues in the case were as follows: a. whether the appellant was in possession of the knife `P11` at the material time; and
 b. whether there was lawful authority or a lawful purpose for his possession of the knife.
 15.The trial judge also stated that the burden of proof on the issue of possession of the knife lay on the prosecution. However, the wording of s 6(2) clearly placed the burden of proving that the possession of the weapon was with lawful authority or for a lawful purpose lay on the accused. The trial judge cited 
PP v Muniandy
 
[1963] MLJ 147
 as authority for this proposition.
 16.After reviewing all the relevant evidence, the trial judge rejected the appellant`s evidence in favour of Sie`s and found that the appellant was indeed in possession of the knife and could not show that there was lawful authority or a lawful purpose for his possession. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
 17.
 The appeal
This appeal turned essentially on the simple question: whose evidence was to be believed? On the one hand there was the evidence of Sie that the appellant was the person that Loo and Ahmad saw putting down the knife and running away. Although Sie was an accomplice, and in the old days that would affect the probative value of his evidence significantly, it is now trite law that under s 135 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) a judge need not warn himself before accepting the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. He need only `scrutinize and weigh carefully` the weight of the uncorroborated accomplice evidence before acting upon it ( 
Ramachandran v PP
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 267
  
[1991] SLR 26
 ).
 18.On the other hand, there was the evidence of the appellant. The problem with his evidence was that there were contradictions in the most important aspect of it, ie the existence of the three or four friends of Sie that the appellant did not know. The most crucial part of the appellant`s defence was that it was not himself, Vincent and Kok Chye that Loo and Ahmad saw but rather these three or four other persons. However, his evidence was inconsistent on this very issue. First, he said in examination-in-chief that he met with these three or four persons before Sie showed him the knife, and he walked part of the way to Geylang Serai with his friends alone, while Sie went home to get the bag. However, during cross-examination he said that he only met them after Sie had gone home and showed him the knife. 
Q: So after Ah Choon had taken the parang what did you do? 
A: We were going to turn and leave. 
Q: Who are `we`? 
A: Ah Chye (Kok Chye), Banka (Vincent) and I. 
 
Q: So Ah Choon went alone to confront the group? 
A: No. 
Q: So what did Ah Choon do with the parang? 
A: He met his friends three to four of them. 
Q: Where did he meet these friends? 
A: At the main road. 
Q: You mean after hearing you, he went to meet his friends? 
A: No. 
Q: Then? 
While we were hearing we saw his friends at the main road. sorry, it should be on the way to Blk 3 Geylang Serai, we met his friends.
 19.Another inconsistency was that he only mentioned meeting Lucas during his cross-examination and Sie subsequently telling him (the appellant) that there was a matter at Geylang Serai after Sie had conversed with Lucas alone. However, in his examination-in-chief, he did not mention seeing Lucas. In fact he said that, when he first met up with Sie, Sie told him that there was a matter at Geylang Serai. Furthermore and quite surprisingly, there was no mention of these three or four friends of Sie in the appellant`s conditioned statement `D1` made four days after the incident.
 20.The appellant`s evidence was also contradicted by Kok Chye`s evidence that he only met the appellant on the way up to his flat. The appellant on the other hand claimed that Kok Chye was with him the entire time and, more importantly, turned away with him after seeing Sie produce a knife.
 21.It was also strange that the appellant did not call Vincent to give evidence on his behalf. After all, only three persons could say whether he held the knife or not, of which two said that he did (ie Sie and Kok Chye). That being the case, it was very surprising that he did not call Vincent to give evidence to refute Sie and Kok Chye`s claims. Section 116, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act states that: 
The Court may presume - 
(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.
 As such, it could be presumed that the appellant did not call Vincent to give evidence because it would only substantiate Sie and Kok Chye`s claims.
 22.On the totality of the evidence, I was of the view that the trial judge was correct to accept Sie`s evidence instead of the appellant`s. Sie`s evidence was clear and consistent. He had nothing to gain from implicating the appellant as he had already been convicted and sentenced. The appellant argued that Sie would be motivated by the fact that he would want to protect his brother and that he was angry with the appellant for not going with him to join in the fight. First, in my view this sort of unsubstantiated speculation was the type that one indulged in when one`s case has little merit. Secondly, and more importantly, it was very difficult to see why Sie would need to implicate the appellant in order to protect his brother. If anything, the appellant`s evidence exonerated Kok Chye. This was because, if the evidence was believed, both of them would be found to have had no part to play in the matter. However, by placing doubt on the appellant`s evidence that he had walked away with Kok Chye when the knife was produced, it also cast doubt on the fact that Kok Chye was not one of the other three men seen by Loo and Ahmad.
 23.Furthermore, it was unclear why Kok Chye would have any reason to implicate the appellant as his brother had already been convicted and sentenced. In fact he would have made his own case, for his lack of participation in the matter, stronger if he and the appellant corroborated each other`s stories that they both walked away from Sie when he produced the knife.
 24.On the other hand the appellant`s evidence was inconsistent, especially on the most important issue: the existence of the three or four friends of Sie. His only other option would have been to call Vincent to testify that he had turned away upon seeing the knife but for some inexplicable reason he did not do so. All this, coupled with the fact that the trial judge had the advantage of witnessing the demeanour of the two witnesses below, led to the conclusion that there was no good reason to deviate from the findings of the trial judge as it could not be said to have been clearly reached against the weight of the evidence ( 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 ).
 25.
 Sentence
The appellant was sentenced to six months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The appellant argued that Sie had antecedents and he was the one who procured the knives and he was only sentenced to six months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. However, the appellant had no previous antecedents and played only a smaller role in the matter as he did not procure the knives. As such, the trial judge had erred in giving him a sentence equal to Sie`s.
 26.In my view, the appellant`s appeal against sentence was without merit. Sie had given himself up to the police immediately at the scene of the crime and had co-operated with the police. On the hand, the appellant fled the scene and tried to fabricate a story about how there were another three or four persons present. As such, despite the appellant`s lack of antecedents and the smaller role he played in the matter, the trial judge below could not be faulted for giving him the same sentence as Sie.","1998-08-03 00:00:00","SG High Court"

TAY YONG KWANG JC
 This is an appeal from a decision of the learned District Judge in OS 38/98, which is an interpleader summons taken out under O 17 of the Rules of Court.
 2.
 The facts leading to this originating summons 
 
Lim Kheng Dee (`Lim`) and Ong Sai Geok (`Ong`) are husband and wife. They owned as joint tenants a unit (`the property`) in the condominium known as Loyang Valley. This was mortgaged to the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (`OCBC`) pursuant to a mortgage dated 10 March 1994. The mortgagors Lim and Ong defaulted in the repayment of the sums due under this mortgage and OCBC exercised its powers of sale thereunder.
 3.The following is a chronology of the material events leading to the interpleader summons before the court:
 
(1)
15 May 1996
-
Focal Finance Ltd (`Focal`) obtained judgment against Lim only.
(2)
25 November 1996
-
Focal registered a writ of seizure and sale (`WSS`) against Lim`s interest in the property.
(3)
5 December 1996
-
Malayan Banking Bhd (`MBB`) obtained judgment against both Lim and Ong.
(4)
6 March 1997
-
MBB registered a WSS against the said property of both Lim and Ong.
(5)
7 May 1997
-
OCBC sold the property.
(6)
16 July 1997
-
OCBC`s sale of the property completed.
(7)
25 July 1997
-
Both Lim and Ong were adjudicated bankrupts.
 4.Upon completion of the sale of the property, and after settlement of all amounts owed under the mortgage, there was a residue of $146,479.29. Ordinarily, such surplus would have been paid over to the mortgagors as the `person who appears from the land-register to be entitled to the mortgaged property` within the meaning of s 74(1) of the Land Titles Act (`LTA`). However, both Focal and MBB made claims to this amount. Initially, there were two other creditors of Lim and Ong which had registered WSS against the property. These two creditors, together with the Official Assignee, withdrew from the dispute concerning the excess amount before the originating summons was first heard in the subordinate courts.
 5.Lim and Ong had, through their solicitors` letter dated 24 July 1997, informed OCBC`s solicitors that they intended to divide the surplus proceeds of sale into two equal shares, paying Focal and another creditor the half share of Lim while paying MBB the other half share belonging to Ong. MBB did not agree with this method of distribution.
 6.After a series of correspondence between the interested parties, past and present, this originating summons was taken out by OCBC for the court to resolve the validity of the competing claims.
 7.
 The deputy registrar`s decision 
 
Before the deputy registrar of the subordinate courts, only Focal and MBB remained as the competing claimants to the surplus proceeds of sale of the property. If Focal`s WSS was effective, Focal would take half of the surplus proceeds of sale since it took the position that Lim`s interest in the property was a half share and its WSS had priority by virtue of ss 37 and 132 LTA. The learned deputy registrar ordered that the whole of the said surplus (less OCBC`s costs of $1,500 for the originating summons) be paid to MBB.
 8.
 The district judge`s decision 
 
Focal appealed to the district judge in chambers. The learned district judge allowed the appeal and ordered MBB to pay Focal half of the surplus less the said $1,500 costs of OCBC. He made no order as to the costs of the appeal before him.
 9.The reasoning of the learned district judge can be found in the following paragraphs of his grounds of decision (with Focal referred to as the first defendant and MBB referred to as the second defendant): 
8 Learned counsel for the first defendant cited the case of 
Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah & Anor
 
[1987] SLR 182
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 341
 . (This Court of Appeal decision was not cited in the proceedings before the deputy registrar). In that case, the court made an order (called the settlement order) that the matrimonial property held under a joint tenancy be sold and the proceeds divided equally. The following appears at [
[1987] SLR 182
, 191-192; 
[1988] 1 MLJ 341
, 347] (also reproduced at p 64 of the first defendant`s bundle of authorities dated 19 May 1998):
 
`... there is still the question whether the settlement order, when made, had the effect of severing the joint tenancy in the said property. We are of the opinion that it did. The court by making the settlement order in the form it did (ie by ordering a sale of the said property and the distribution of the proceeds of sale equally between the parties) intended to divide the said property between the parties without any limitation as to the length of life of either of them`.
 
9 Learned counsel submitted that by analogy, the court order pursuant to the first defendants` writ of seizure and sale (which appears at p 26 of the affidavit of Lee Siew Sen filed on 15 January 1998 in support of the plaintiffs` interpleader summons) must have the same effect, that is, the court`s order that the interest of the judgment debtor Lim Kheng Dee (one of the joint tenants) in the property be seized and sold must be construed as an order that has severed the joint tenancy. 
10 Learned counsel for the second defendant tried to distinguish 
 Sivakolunthu 
`s case by saying that in that case there was an order for sale whereas in the order here, pursuant to the writ of seizure and sale of the first defendant, (as appears at p 26 of the affidavit of Lee Siew Sen filed on 15 January 1998), there was only an order for attachment and not for sale. I did not accept this argument as a plain reading of the order made, as appears at p 26 of the affidavit of Lee Siew Sen filed on 15 January 1998, clearly shows that the order was made pursuant to the writ of seizure and sale and the order was that not only the property be `attached` but it is to be `taken in execution to satisfy the judgment` obtained by the first defendant (the underlining is mine for emphasis). 
11 Learned counsel for the first defendant submitted that, as in the case of 
 Sivakolunthu 
, there was an order for sale in present case. He said that the order by writ of seizure and sale, as appears at p 26 of the affidavit of Lee Siew Sen filed on 15 January 1998, was not only for a seizure. That order reads that the property is to be `... attached and taken in execution to satisfy the judgment ...`. He said that obviously one cannot satisfy a judgment unless the property is sold. I accepted the submissions of learned counsel for the first defendant. 
12 Accordingly, I allowed the appeal by the first defendant and set aside the order of the deputy registrar ordering that the sum of $146,479.29 be paid to the second defendant, after deduction of the plaintiff`s costs of $1,500. 
13 As the first defendant was claiming only half of the sum of $146,479.29, I ordered the second defendant to pay the sum of $73,239.65 to the first defendant (less $1,500 being the plaintiff`s costs). I did not make any order on costs of the appeal, as learned counsel for the first defendant conceded that he did not cite 
 Sivakolunthu 
`s case in the proceedings below and counsel for the second defendant said he did not ask for any costs in the proceedings before the deputy registrar.
 10.MBB then lodged an appeal against the learned district judge`s decision.
 11.
 My decision 
 
On 1 February 1992, the provisions on the charging order on land in O 50 of the then Rules of the Supreme Court were repealed. In place of the charging order on land, the Rules introduced the writ of seizure and sale against land. On 1 April 1992, the then Rules of the Subordinate Courts followed suit. Both sets of Rules have been consolidated as the Rules of Court since 1 April 1996.
 12.The Land Titles Act applies to the property in question by virtue of s 4 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act. Sections 131 to 136 of the LTA and O 47 rr 4 and 5 of the Rules of Court provide the broad framework for a WSS on land or immovable property. Section 131 of the LTA speaks of a writ of execution against `land`, which is defined in s 4(1) of the Act to include any estate or interest therein. `Interest`, in turn, is defined as meaning any interest in land recognised as such by law and including an estate in land. Order 47 r 4(1) speaks of `immovable property or any interest therein` and `attaching the interest of the judgment debtor in the immovable property`. Before we can determine whether `interest` includes a judgment debtor`s interest as one of the joint tenants of a property, we must first examine the legal qualities of a joint tenancy.
 13.WJM Ricquier in 
 Land Law 
 (1985 Ed) at pp 54 and 55 states: 
There are two forms of co-ownership applicable in Singapore, joint tenancy and tenancy in common. In the case of joint tenancy, A and B, as against the rest of the world, have the rights of a single owner, although they have individual rights as against one another. In particular, when one joint tenant dies, his interest, irrespective of any direction to the contrary in his will, and of the intestacy rules, passes to the other joint tenant(s): this is called the right of survivorship. The other unique characteristic of joint tenancy is the presence of the four unities. Unity of possession indicates that each of the tenants is equally entitled to the property; unity of interest indicates that their interests must be equal in quality and quantity (and not, eg, a fee simple and a lease for twenty-one years); unity of title means that all the tenants must derive their interests under the same document; and unity of time means that all interests must vest at the same time. Unity of possession is common to both forms of co-ownership. If any of the others is missing the parties are tenants in common rather than joint tenants.
 
Tenancy in common is quite different. There is no right of survivorship and each tenant in common can leave his share of the property in his will. Whereas in a joint tenancy no individual can be an owner of a distinct share of the property, tenants in common do own shares in a piece of land that has not yet been divided up between them.
 14.In similar vein, Associate Professor Tan Sook Yee writes in 
 Principles of Singapore Land Law 
 (1994 Ed) as follows (at pp 87 and 88):
 Joint tenancy is that form of co-ownership where each of the co-owners owns the whole interest. There are no shares. As between the joint tenants themselves, they have rights; however, as against the world, they are viewed as one.
 15.Section 53(3) LTA permits tenants in common to convert their co-ownership to one of joint tenancy by lodging an instrument of declaration `that they hold the estate or interest in their respective shares in the registered land as joint tenants of the entire estate or interest thereof`. All shares therefore merge upon conversion to joint tenancy. Order 47 r 5(g), which allows the Sheriff to apply to the court for directions concerning the sale of immovable property seized under a WSS, also provides for notice of such application to be given to the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor and `any other party interested in the property`. It can of course be argued that `any other party interested in the property` includes joint tenants. However, this should not be the case. Although joint tenancy in immovable property is an interest recognised in law, the `interest of the judgment debtor` attachable under a WSS under O 47 r 4(1)(a) must surely be a distinct and identifiable one. A joint tenant has no distinct and identifiable share in land for as long as the joint tenancy subsists. To seize one joint tenant`s interest is to seize also the interest of his co-owners when they are not subject to the judgment which is being enforced. Similarly, `the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor` which may be sold in execution (s 135(1) LTA) must be distinct and identifiable and cannot be a joint interest held with someone not subject to the judgment and the execution. A WSS cannot therefore attach the interest of a joint tenant unless it concomitantly severs the joint tenancy.
 16.Severance of a joint tenancy may be achieved at common law by alienation of an interest, mutual agreement or mutual conduct. The bankruptcy of a joint tenant also severs the tenancy and passes his interest to his trustee in bankruptcy (
 Cheshire & Burn`s Modern Law of Real Property 
 (14th Ed, 1988) at p 212). Severance may also be achieved through statutory mechanisms such as, in the case of registered land, an instrument of declaration pursuant to s 53(5) LTA. None of these acts of severance took place in this case. As can be seen from the chronology of events, by the time Lim and Ong were adjudicated bankrupts, the mortgagee`s sale of the property had been completed. Similarly, their declaration of intention in their solicitors` letter of 24 July 1997 to divide the surplus proceeds of sale into two equal shares did not and could not change the fact of their joint tenancy ex post facto.
 17.In my opinion, the Court of Appeal`s decision in 
 Sivakolunthu v Shanmugam Nagaiah & Anor 
 (supra) cannot apply to the situation here. The order for the sale of the property held in joint tenancy and the division of the proceeds therefrom (called the `settlement order` in that case) was made pursuant to s 106(1) Women`s Charter (the precursor of the present s 112), which has no application to the facts of this case whatsoever. However, the Court of Appeal also said the following immediately after the passage quoted by the learned district judge (at 
[1987] SLR 182
, 192; 
[1988] 1 MLJ 341
, 347): 
The severance was not effected by an act of the parties but by an order of court. In principle, there is no reason why a court order may not have such an effect. All orders of court made in exercise of its powers to make partition orders have such effect even where the order has not been carried into effect before the death of a party to the proceedings.
 A WSS against land is an order of court granted ex parte but it is not an order that must necessarily result in a sale. This is reinforced by the use of the words `and thereafter, if necessary, to sell the said interest ...` in Form 95E which is the direction to the Sheriff/Bailiff. The sale may be postponed and subsequently abandoned because of the sale of any other property of the judgment debtor (O 47 r 5(c)). There may be an appointment of a receiver of the rents and profits or a receiver and manager of the immovable property `in lieu of sale` (O 47 r 5(d)). The WSS may be withdrawn (O 47 r 9). Similarly, registration of the WSS may be cancelled because it has lapsed (s 134 LTA) or has been withdrawn (s 136 LTA).
 18.Bearing in mind that any of the above contingencies could happen, it would be creating a fine mess to hold that a WSS when registered severs a joint tenancy. What would be the position of the co-owners in relation to each other should the WSS subsequently be withdrawn or its registration lapse? Do they revert to being joint tenants again? If the WSS is renewed or a second or subsequent one issued, do the rights of the co-owners change once again? A further argument against severance is that registration of the WSS (if it were possible to do so) merely prevents transfers of interest by the joint tenant, such that there is no severance of the joint tenancy until the Sheriff transfers the judgment debtor`s interest to another person. In favour of this is the fact that on the register, the judgment debtor remains a joint owner of the property, and in terms of form, maintains the same interest as his co-owner. For these reasons, I hold that registration of the WSS does not sever a joint tenancy.
 19.My holding accords with the legal position in Canada. The position in Canada is that delivery of a writ of execution to the Sheriff does not by itself amount to severance: 
Power v Grace
 
[1932] 1 DLR 801
; 
Re Young
 
[1968] 70 DLR (2d) 594
; 
Re McDonald and The Queen
 
[1969] 8 DLR (3d) 666
; 
Sunglo Lumber Ltd v McKenna
 
[1974] 48 DLR (3d) 154
; and the point was not doubted in 
Bank of Montreal v Pawluk
 
[1992] 88 DLR (4th) 570
. 
 Power v Grace 
 was a decision of the York County Court, and the report of the judgment is abbreviated. It involved an execution lodged against a joint tenant who died before sale. The question was whether the lodging of execution in the hands of the Sheriff amounted to severance. Widdifield, Co Ct J is reported to have held: 
Although the delivery of the writ to the sheriff binds the lands from the date of delivery, it does not change the ownership ...
 
The continuance of the joint tenancy depends on the maintenance of the union of title, interest and possession, and a destruction of any of these unities leads to a severance.
 
...
 
The trend of the authorities is that a mere lien or charge on the land, either by a co-tenant or by operation of law, is not sufficient to sever the joint tenancy; there must be something that amounts to an alienation of title.
 The decision was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal: [1932] 2 DLR 793.
 20.In 
 Re Young 
, the British Columbia Court of Appeal had to consider whether the mere registration of a judgment under the Execution Act severed a joint tenancy so as to prevent the operation of the right of survivorship. Maclean and MacFarlane JJA were both of the opinion that mere registration was not sufficient. In doing so, they departed from a prior decision of their court, 
Re Application of Penn
 
[1951] 4 WWR (NS) 452
, and followed 
 Power v Grace 
. The statement of Widdifield Co Ct J above was cited and approved by Maclean JA. McFarlane JA agreed with Maclean JA on this point. Davey CJBC dissented. His Honour was of the opinion that upon interpretation of the relevant statute, registration created an equitable charge, which severs a joint tenancy. This flowed from the fact that equity will do what the joint tenant intended to do and an equitable charge evinces an intention to sever where it is necessary to do so in order to implement a contract entered into by the joint tenant (at p 598). His Honour further noted (at p 599): 
I must say that I find that result satisfactory, because it makes answerable for a judgment the judgment debtor`s interest in a joint tenancy over which he had in himself complete power of disposal in his lifetime, and avoids one of the highly technical consequences of a joint tenancy, as contrasted with a tenancy in common, that has little to commend it in the light of modern needs. Regrettably, it falls short of making that interest liable after the joint tenant`s prior death for his debts generally.
 In Canada, therefore, registration of a judgment also does not sever a joint tenancy.
 21.There is also a conceptual difficulty in Focal`s arguments that a WSS severs a joint tenancy and attaches to the share of the judgment debtor according to the number of joint tenants. Megarry in 
 Law of Real Property 
 (3rd Ed, 1966), states at p 416: 
Although no joint tenant owned any distinct share in the land, yet each had a potential share equal in size to that of his companions, and so depending upon the number of joint tenants at the time in question.
 This statement does not mean that joint tenants would always take a share according to the number of joint tenants. It is at best a `potential` equal share. In matrimonial property disputes, as in any other property disputes, proportionate severance has never been an immutable rule where joint tenancies were involved. The maxim, equality is equity, if applied indiscriminately to all circumstances would create inequity in a great number of cases, whether they involve matrimonial disputes or otherwise. The shares of joint tenants must be ascertained with regard to all the circumstances of the case. Lim and Ong`s declaration of intention in their solicitors` letter of 24 July 1997 has little value as it was expressed only after all the events had taken place and it became clear that both of them would not benefit from the sale proceeds in any way. If Ong had not been a judgment debtor too, one should not be surprised if she were to assert that she should have the lion`s share in the property despite the joint tenancy. Equally, it should not be surprising if Lim came out to support his wife`s assertion.
 22.Focal submitted further that the rule that joint tenants have shares in the estate proportionate to the number of joint tenants upon severance is recognised by the statutory form to be filed under s 53(5) LTA. In this form, a joint tenant who desires to sever a joint tenancy declares that: 
... I am the registered proprietor of the land as joint tenant together with the other Registered Proprietor/s hereinafter mentioned and that I wish to sever the joint tenancy and hold the land as a tenant in common with the other Registered Proprietor/s in the share proportionate to the number of joint tenants.
 With respect, this form does not decree proportionate severance in every case. If the registered proprietors become tenants in common without specifying their respective shares, s 53(2) LTA would presume that they are entitled in equal shares. The form can be modified to express the intention of the joint tenants (see s 7 Interpretation Act). Of course, if a dispute then arises among the joint tenants, they can take the matter to court for their various entitlements to be determined. Even s 57(5A)(b) of the Income Tax Act recognizes that joint owners of land do not always take equal shares in the land or the sale proceeds thereof. That section therefore has to provide a presumption as follows: 
For the purposes of payment of any tax due. ... from the proceeds of sale of any immovable property owned by two or more persons as joint owners, the following provisions shall apply:
 
(a) ... 
(b) it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, ... that the joint owners of any immovable property shall share the proceeds of sale of the property equally;
 23.How then can a judgment creditor proceed against a judgment debtor who is one of two or more joint tenants of land? The answer appears to be, by appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution (O 30 and O 51). This is one of the modes of enforcement of a judgment contemplated in O 45 r 1(1). Under O 30 r 1, an injunction ancillary or incidental to an order appointing a receiver may also be made to restrain the judgment debtor from assigning, charging or otherwise dealing with the property.
 24.In summary, a WSS against immovable property cannot be used to enforce a judgment against a debtor who is one of two or more joint tenants of that immovable property. The WSS taken out and registered by Focal was therefore invalid and must be set aside. Accordingly, MBB is entitled to the entire sum of the surplus proceeds of sale after deducting OCBC`s costs of $1,500.
 25.I respectfully disagree with the learned district judge and allow MBB`s appeal. The costs of this appeal should follow the event. However, in view of the way the application proceeded before the deputy registrar and the district judge, I do not propose to disturb the decisions below that there be no order as to costs at each stage. The deputy registrar`s and the district judge`s orders on costs are to stand. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs of this appeal before the High Court to be paid by Focal to MBB.","1998-12-11 00:00:00","SG High Court"

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 On 22 July 1998, the appellant pleaded guilty to two charges: 
... that you on 29 April 1998 at about 8.35am along Corporation Road, Singapore, did permit one Naim bin Pardi to use motor lorry No XA 9897 E whilst there was not in force in relation to the user of the said vehicle, such a policy of insurance in respect of the third party risk as complies with the requirements of this Act, and you have thereby committed an offence s 3(1) and punishable under s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189).
 
... that you on 29 April 1998 at about 8.35am along Corporation Road, Singapore, did permit one Naim bin Pardi to use motor lorry No XA 9897 E for which a licence under Part 1 of RTA Cap 276 was not in force, to wit, road tax expired on 31.12.97 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 29(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 For the first charge, the district judge fined the appellant $600 and ordered that he be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes for the minimum period of 12 months. The appellant was fined $500 for the second charge.
 2.By Criminal Revision No 23 of 1998, the appellant petitioned for criminal revision in respect of both charges. In Magistrates Appeal No 209/98/01, he appealed against the sentence for the first charge. On 27 October 1998, I dismissed both applications. These are my reasons.
 3.
 The appellant`s case 
 
Counsel applied for the appeal against sentence to be heard first, so that, if the appeal were successful, the defence would not seek revision of the decision below. I refused to allow such an application of the law. A bona fide petition for revision appeals to the court to judiciously exercise its powers to correct any error of law which appears from the record of the case. To suggest that the allegedly grave error of law could be corrected by a successful appeal against sentence would abuse the process of revision. In the circumstances, I directed counsel for the appellant to submit on the petition for revision first.
 4.The appellant`s case was that on the date of the accident, 29 April 1998, legal title to the vehicle No XA 9897 E had been transferred. This, he claimed, had been effected in the sale of the vehicle to Transit-Mixed Concrete Ltd (`TMC`) in an agreement recorded on 13 March 1998. His case was that the driver in question, Naim bin Pardi (`Pardi`), although formerly in his employ had transferred his services to the purchasers of the vehicle, following the sale of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the appellant contended that he should not be held liable for the offence of permitting the vehicle to be driven when there was no valid insurance coverage and unpaid road tax.
 5.Alternatively, his case was that, although the original insurance coverage by UMBC Insurans Sdn Bhd`s had expired on 31 March 1998, the vehicle was insured by Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd (`Eagle`) at the material time. The evidence he adduced in support of this was a Land Transport Authority Vehicle Information Enquiry Reply. This document was obtained on 31 July 1998.
 6.
 The appeal 
 
I noted that the district judge had taken into account the sale of the vehicle at para 7 of her grounds of decision. She made two observations which should be put on record. First, the transfer had not been effected. Second, she found that nonetheless it was an offence for him to permit another person to use the vehicle pending the transfer when there was no valid insurance policy or road tax in force.
 7.Before me, I was assisted by the evidence of the driver, Pardi, now working as a sweeper, who on 20 October 1998 had sworn an affidavit stating that he had worked as a part-time driver for the appellant`s company, Zement Transit Services, up till 29 April 1998 when the accident occurred. Pardi went even further to declare that he had never heard of the purchasers, TMC; nor, for that matter, was he aware of the sale of the vehicle he was driving on 29 April 1998. I was not given any evidence that contradicted Pardi`s statement. In my view, it had been clearly established that Pardi drove the vehicle in question, No XA 9897 E, under the directions of the only employer he knew, that is, the appellant.
 8.Next, I considered the evidence on whether the vehicle was insured at the material time. In this respect, Staff Sergeant Oh Hwee Kee had sworn an affidavit dated 20 October 1998, stating that enquiries with the LTA showed that as at 29 April 1998 the vehicle was without a valid license. The LTA records stated that the present insurance policy had been taken up with effect from 3 June 1998. Prior to this, the previous policy had expired on 31 December 1997 and there was no record of any insurance coverage in the intervening period. I found that counsel for the appellant`s two letters to Eagle and one letter to the purchasers, TMC, demonstrated nothing more than a futile attempt to determine whether the vehicle was insured by Eagle.
 9.Staff Sergeant Oh`s affidavit also included a letter from Eagle, now trading as Zurich Eagle Insurance (ZES). ZES had forwarded to S/Sergeant Oh a copy of the insurance broker`s instructions in a letter dated 4 May 1998, directing that insurance coverage for XA 9897 E be cancelled. The evidence was that the sale of the vehicle had been aborted. Therefore the transfer of ownership of XA 9897 E had not been effected. TMC only purchased insurance for the vehicles whose transfer of ownership had been registered, that is, Nos XA 7564, XA 7318 and WB 1433.
 10.
 Conclusion 
 
On the totality of the evidence before me, I found that the appellant had possession and control of the use of XA 9897 on 29 April 1998 and that there was no valid insurance coverage or road tax in force. I could not find any good reason to intervene with the district judge`s imposition of a fine and the mandatory period of disqualification. Accordingly, the petition for revision and the appeal against sentence were dismissed.","1999-01-11 00:00:00","SG High Court"

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
GOH JOON SENG J
 The plaintiff`s claim was for damages for libel contained in two letters from the defendant, namely: (i). a letter of 8 January 1997 with details attached (`letter of 8 January`) to the Council of the Association of Singapore Realtors (`ASR`);
 (ii). a letter of 20 February 1997 (`letter of 20 February`) to the plaintiff`s solicitors Sim Mong Teck & Partners enclosing a copy of the letter of 8 January, all carbon copied to ASR, Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (`SISV`) and the Association of Singapore Real Estate Agents (`ASREA`).
 2.The defendant admitted the publication, but denied liability, relying on the defence of justification, fair comment and qualified privilege. The defendant also counterclaimed for damages for libel contained in the November 1996 issue of an in-house newsletter (`the newsletter`) of Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd (`Louis Yeap Realty`) which runs a real estate agency.
 3.The plaintiff joined issue with the defendant on his defence and contended that the publication was actuated by malice on the part of the defendant. On the defendant`s counterclaim, the plaintiff denied that the words contained in the newsletter were understood or capable of being understood to refer to the defendant. In any event, they were true in substance and in fact. In the alternative they were fair comment and were published on an occasion of qualified privilege.
 4.At the end of the hearing I found for the plaintiff and awarded him $40,000 plus costs. I dismissed the defendant`s counterclaim with costs. The defendant has appealed to the Court of Appeal. I now give my reasons.
 5.
 Terms of remuneration of a marketing agent of Louis Yeap Realty 
 
If an agent secures an exclusive authorisation from the owner to sell the property he is known as the `exclusive lister`. The exclusive lister may appoint an agent (`marketing agent`) to market the property under a co-broking agreement. On the sale of the property by the marketing agent, the commission is divided equally between the exclusive lister and the marketing agent subject to an overrider of 20% of the commission to Louis Yeap Realty. If the marketing agent (`Marketing Agent A`) is unable to find a buyer before the expiry of his appointment, he submits a list of six prospective purchasers who have responded to his advertisements. Another marketing agent, Marketing Agent B, is then appointed to market the property. During the term of Marketing Agent B`s appointment, if the property is sold to a purchaser who is among the six named in Marketing Agent A`s list, Marketing Agent B will get only 10%. The balance will be shared equally between the exclusive lister and Marketing Agent A, subject again to the overrider of 20% of the commission to Louis Yeap Realty.
 6.
 The parties 
 
The plaintiff is the managing director of Louis Yeap Realty. The defendant was an estate agent with Louis Yeap Realty from 29 December 1995 to 13 January 1997.
 7.
 The factual background 
 
In the course of his work, the defendant marketed several properties under Louis Yeap Realty. These included 26 Burnfoot Terrace, 7A Jalan Rindu, Liberty Warehouse and 26 Pasir Panjang Hill. These properties were the subject matter of the two letters. 7A Jalan Rindu was also the subject matter of the newsletter and of the counterclaim. It is therefore necessary to recount what transpired in these four transactions.
 8.
 26 Burnfoot Terrace (`Burnfoot Terrace`) 
 
On 18 January 1996, the plaintiff was given the exclusive authorisation by the owner of the property to sell it for him. The plaintiff in turn appointed one Stephen Pang to be the marketing agent under a co-broking agreement. The plaintiff had known Stephen Pang since 1965 when they were both working for a pharmaceutical company. Stephen Pang`s appointment was for the period 18 January 1996 to 26 February 1996. The appointment was then extended to 11 March 1996. Stephen Pang placed a number of advertisements in the newspapers giving the `built in` area as 1,500 sq ft. He could not find a buyer for the property. On the expiry of his appointment, he submitted a list of 13 potential purchasers who had viewed the property.
 9.As an outgoing marketing agent was entitled to submit a list of only six potential purchasers, the plaintiff told Stephen Pang that he would take note of only the first six names in the list and ignore the rest.
 10.On 12 March 1996, the plaintiff appointed the defendant as the marketing agent to market the property for the period 12 March 1996 to 18 April 1996. The defendant inserted a few advertisements also giving the `built in` area as 1,500 sq ft.
 11.On 25 March 1996, the defendant, through a housing agent with another real estate agency, secured a buyer for the property. In consideration of the payment of 1%, that is $10,900, the buyer was granted an option to purchase the property for $1,090,000.
 12.The deal was rescinded by the buyer when he discovered that the `built in` area was only 1,195 sq ft and not 1,500 sq ft.
 13.On 2 April 1996, a potential buyer was referred to Stephen Pang. He was not one of the first six potential purchasers in Stephen Pang`s list. So the commission, less the 20% to Louis Yeap Realty, would have to be shared equally among Stephen Pang, plaintiff and defendant. Unknown to the plaintiff, Stephen Pang had kept in touch with the owner after his appointment as the marketing agent had lapsed.
 14.While on the way to meet his potential buyer to collect the 1% option fee, Stephen Pang called the defendant seeking his help to draw up an option and requesting the latter to meet him at Burnfoot Terrace with the option. The defendant refused. Stephen Pang then called the office of Louis Yeap Realty. The call was picked up by the plaintiff`s son, Paul Yeap, who immediately rushed down to Burnfoot Terrace with the option for the owner`s signature and the deal was thus secured. According to the plaintiff and Stephen Pang, for the part played by Paul Yeap, Stephen Pang suggested in the presence of the defendant that 10% of the commission be paid to Paul Yeap. They both said the defendant did not object to the suggestion. This however was disputed by the defendant.
 15.On completion, Louis Yeap Realty received 1[lowbar]% commission amounting to $16,500. This was divided equally among the plaintiff, defendant and Stephen Pang. On 20 July 1997, the defendant was handed a cheque for $3,520 arrived as follows:
 
(1)
1/3 of $16,500
$5500
(2)
Less 20% to Louis Yeap Realty, ie
$1100
$4400
(3)
Less 10% of that to Paul Yeap
$ 440
(4)
Less 10% to the referrer who referred the buyer to Stephen Pang
$ 440
(5)
Nett amount
$3520
 16.The defendant was unhappy with the 10% fee each paid to Paul Yeap and Stephen Pang`s referrer. So, on the instruction of the plaintiff, Louis Yeap Realty reimbursed the defendant the $440 paid to Paul Yeap. The cheque was enclosed with the plaintiff`s letter of 22 July 1996 setting out the sequence as follows:

Dear Pete,
 
RE: 26 BURNFOOT TERRACE,
 
SINGAPORE 459818
 
I refer to our meeting on 19 July 1996 regarding your objections raised concerning payment of a 10% referral fee paid to Paul Yeap. Because Paul is my son, it is necessary that this matter be placed on record to avoid distortion and misinterpretation in view of his relationship with the company.
 
The following sequence is on file. You are welcome to correct any events which are inaccurate:
 
(1) Stephen Pang was the first LY Agent to market subject property. The internal Co-broking Agreement with Stephen expired on 11 March 1996. 
(2) You became the second LY Agent as per our Co-broking Agreement dated 12 March 1996 which expired on 18 April 1996. 
(3) You commenced marketing the property as of 16 March 1996 and through another agent, Ms Sylvia Ng of REB, secured a buyer Mr Lai Kam Yew on 25 March 1996 at the sale price of S$1,090,000.00. This would be a co-broking arrangement between Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd and REB based on a 3-way Co-broke. However, this sale did not materialise as the deposit payment was withdrawn. 
(4) Sometime on 31 March 1996 or 1 April 1996, Stephen Pang contacted you as he had an interested party to view subject property. There was some miscommunication between both of you but as the buyer, Mr Ahamed Shariff bin Ana Mohd Ibrhim, was particularly keen, Stephen called Paul for help. It was a productive meeting and a 1% deposit was taken. Sale price was S$1,100,000.00. 
(5) Because of Paul`s involvement in the negotiations and completing the documentation, it was agreed that Paul would receive a 10% referral and I recall discussing and confirmed this referral with both Stephen and yourself. Collectively, there was no objection then and the subject was closed as the paperwork had been completed including the standard Transaction Form which spelt out the split in the commission. 
(6) When the proceeds of the commission were made on 19 July 1996, you expressed dissatisfaction that you had to contribute one third (1/3) of the 10% referral fee to Paul. You raised the issue on the following: 
(a) Paul initially told you that you would only receive 10% as a referral for the sale. This was quickly corrected the next day as the buyer was not on Stephen`s list and that the sale would be co-broked 3-way (Louis Yeap/Stephen Pang/Pete Choo). 
(b) If you had known that it was a 3-way co-broke, you would have preferred to meet Stephen Pang and his buyer to save the referral fee. 
(7) To avoid further dialogue on the subject, I have decided to return your share of the Singapore Dollars Four Hundred and Forty Only (S$440.00) paid to Paul. This deduction cannot come from Paul since he did his job to negotiate and complete the documentations. The company will now absorb your portion of the referral fee paid to Paul.
 
Yours faithfully
 
LOUIS YEAP REALTY PTE LTD
 
Signed
 
Louis Yeap
 There was no reply from the defendant disputing the sequence set out in the plaintiff`s letter.

The plaintiff was granted exclusive authorisation by the owner to sell the property for the period 25 February 1995 to 30 April 1995.
 18.As the exclusive lister, the plaintiff appointed one Ronny Foo to be the first marketing agent for the period 1 March 1995 to 15 March 1995. On expiry thereof, the plaintiff appointed one Chua Yu-Jin as the second marketing agent for the period 16 March 1995 to 16 April 1995.
 19.The property remained unsold at the expiry of the plaintiff`s exclusive authorisation.
 20.In May 1996, the owner contacted the plaintiff again and gave him exclusive authorisation to sell the property for the period 13 May 1996 to 13 August 1996.
 21.The plaintiff then appointed the defendant as the marketing agent for the period 13 May 1996 to 12 June 1996. At the request of the defendant the appointment was extended to 21 July 1996.
 22.The defendant secured a buyer for the property at $1,600,000. An option at a fee of $16,000 was granted. The purchaser however failed to exercise the option and his option fee was forfeited. He however indicated he would be interested to buy the property at $1,450.000.
 23.The plaintiff`s exclusive authorisation was extended to 15 November 1996. He then appointed one Terence Teng to be the marketing agent for the period 14 August 1996 to 16 September 1996. Terence Teng was unable to secure a buyer.
 24.The plaintiff then appointed one Thomas Tham to market the property. Thomas Tham is a personal friend of the plaintiff. In October 1996, Thomas Tham found a buyer for the property at $1,448,000. When this was reported to the plaintiff, he mentioned it to the defendant. The defendant thereupon insisted that his buyer who did not exercise the option should be given right of first refusal to buy the property at $1,450.000. This was only $2,000 more than what seemed to be a serious offer of $1,448,000 from Thomas Tham`s buyer. The plaintiff doubted that the defendant`s buyer was still interested since he had allowed his option to lapse more than two and a half months ago. Nevertheless, the plaintiff persuaded Thomas Tham to forego his entitlement to 50% commission as the marketing agent and agree to a three-way co-broking arrangement whereby the plaintiff, defendant and Thomas Tham would each get one third of the commission. But this was not acceptable to the defendant. The plaintiff then prevailed on Thomas Tham to delay finalizing the sale over the weekend so that the defendant could confirm with his buyer if the latter still wished to buy the property at $1,450,000. Three days later, the defendant disclosed that his buyer was no longer interested. Thomas Tham was then given clearance to proceed with the sale to his buyer at $1,448,000. By this time, Thomas Tham`s buyer was no longer prepared to buy the property at $1,448,000 as he felt that his offer had been used as a lever to persuade the defendant`s buyer to make an offer of $1,450,000. The property was eventually sold for $1,430,000 as the owner was cash strapped.

 26 Pasir Panjang Hill 
 
This property belonged to one Cho Jock Min and his wife. On being given the exclusive authorisation to sell the property, the plaintiff appointed the defendant as the first marketing agent to market the property for the period 19 June 1996 to 28 July 1996. The defendant failed to secure a buyer.
 26.On 6 August 1996, the plaintiff appointed one Tony Teo to be the marketing agent. Tony Teo secured a buyer on 27 August 1996 that is within three weeks.
 27.Cho Jock Min was appreciative of the results achieved by Tony Teo. To express his appreciation he wrote a letter dated 11 September 1996 reading as follows: 
Mr Tony Teo
 
Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd
 
137 Market Street [num ]11-02
 
Bank of East Asia Building
 
Singapore 048943
 
Dear Tony,
 
My wife and I wish to extend our appreciation for the professionalism and sheer hard work by which you were able to secure a buyer for our house. Despite the current gloom over Singapore`s property market and the cautious attitudes of both home sellers and buyers, your press advertisements were able to attract the attention of the right group of people.
 
Once again, our thanks to you for selling our house in a remarkably short period of three weeks, and at the price we wanted.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Signed
 
Cho Jock Min
 28.Cho Jock Min`s letter of appreciation was later published along with other testimonials in Louis Yeap Realty`s brochure without the names of the agents to whom the testimonials were addressed. The rationale for leaving out the names of the addressees of the testimonials was stated in the caption which read: 
... The identity of the agents has been intentionally omitted in fairness to many other LY agents whose testimonials have not been selected for publication.
 29.
 The newsletter 
 
In November 1996, the plaintiff published in the newsletter the following article: 
An example of over-confidence and greed that backfired
 
This case happened in October 1996 between two LY associates. The management feel it is important enough to document the event openly as a learning experience so that a similar occurrence would be avoided in future.
 
First agent was marketing this two-storey Semi-D (L99) and obtained a buyer for S$1.6m. Unfortunately, the buyer failed to exercise the option and lost his 1% deposit. The owner who was anxious to save the sale had asked the buyer to propose an alternative price and the response from the buyer was $1.45m. Expectedly, the owner was not agreeable to this price and the matter was left as it was.
 
The responsibility to market this property was then passed to the second agent. After five weeks, a buyer was identified at S$1.45m. Agent [num ]2 took three days to convince the owner to accept this price which was finally agreed. The proposed options was then exchanged between the buyer`s and vendor`s lawyers and at this stage, agent [num ]1 insisted that his buyer who first made the offer of S$1.45m should be given priority. As the transaction was then at a critical stage of negotiation, agent [num ]2 was agreeable to a three-way co-broke (Lister/Agent [num ]1/Agent [num ]2). This compromise to co-broke three-way was not accepted by agent [num ]1 who claimed that he had earlier spent heavily on advertising the property and the commission proceeds would be split only between Lister and himself as a matter of policy.
 
As agent [num ]1 was confident that his buyer would take up the sale, Agent [num ]2 had to stop further discussions with his buyer and the relevant lawyers involved.
 
After three days, agent [num ]1 conceded finally that his buyer had changed his mind and wanted to negotiate for an even lower price. At this point, it was too late to go back to agent [num ]2`s buyer who felt that he was played out by agent [num ]2 in favor of another buyer.
 
The ending is obvious. No one benefited and at the expense of the owner who is still waiting for a buyer!!!
 
It would have been a win-win situation if only agent [num ]1 had not thought so much about his personal interest and let agent [num ]2 close the deal. This expensive experience has cost the relevant parties S$21,750 in commission just because of personal greed and over-confidence.
 30.
 Liberty Warehouse 
 
This property was sold by the defendant as the marketing agent appointed by the plaintiff. Completion took place on 4 December 1996. Following that, the defendant submitted his sale transaction form in which he stated: `expenses totalled $55.62`. This was apparently the costs of two newspaper advertisements inserted by the defendant. He was entitled to be reimbursed half of that by the plaintiff. But as no particulars were given as to what the expenses were and without supporting documents, the plaintiff did not reimburse the defendant pending their submission.
 31.
 Letter of 8 January 
 
It was against this backdrop that the defendant wrote the letter of 8 January addressed to the Council of ASR. It contained the offending words complained of. In order that the offending words may be construed in the context in which they appeared, the letter of 8 January is reproduced hereunder with the offending words complained of in italics:

Dear Sirs
 
Breach of code of conduct and ethics by Louis Yeap Beng San of Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd
 
 I have several grievances against Mr Louis Yeap, a respected and senior member of your Association
.
 
 Generally, the level of professionalism in the industry today is rock bottom. I have no wish to report him to IRAS, the licensing body for Housing Agents at this moment in time as I believe you have the power to discipline an errant member
.
 
I sincerely hope that you can redress my grievances expeditiously, the details which I have attached herewith for your perusal. I can be reached at Pager No 9-215-9496.
 
Yours faithfully

A Deprivation of approximately $900 in my share of commission on the sale of 26 Burnfoot Terrace
 
It is well known in the market that Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd is one of the very few real estate agencies in Singapore to have Exclusive Listers and Marketing Agents. As an Agent, he is usually given a one month period to market the property assigned to him by the Lister. After the term expired, ie one month, the Lister will re-assign the property to another Agent in the event that the first Agent is unsuccessful in disposing the property.
 
The first Agent will then submit a list of maximum six (6) names of potential buyers to the company. Should a buyer in his list purchase the property subsequently after the second Agent has taken over the marketing, the second Agent would receive a maximum of 10% on the commission paid as a token referral from both the Lister (50%) and the first Agent (50%). All this is spelt out in the Company`s Operations Manual. (Please see Appendix I.)
 
In the case of 26 Burnfoot Terrace, I was appointed the second Agent after six (6) weeks of unsuccessful efforts on the part of the first Agent, Stephen Pang. Stephen is an old friend of the Lister, Louis Yeap, and they have known each other for more than 30 years. In fact, Stephen was Louis` subordinate in his salaried employment in a MNC before he joined the real estate industry.
 
When I was marketing the property after Stephen`s term expired, he brought potential buyers to the property without liaising with me, which means, in effect there were two agents marketing the property at the same time. When I reported to Louis on Stephen`s violation on the Code of Ethics, he brushed me aside saying that it was a small matter. Subsequently, he even allowed Stephen to submit a list of 13 potential buyers instead of the usual six (6) names. (Please see Appendix II.)
 
On 24 March 1996, after 12 days of marketing, I found a buyer. The option to purchase was granted on the same day and a 1% option money was received by the seller. Since the buyer was not on Stephen`s list, he would merely receive a reimbursement for his advertising costs.
 
On 1 April 1996, one week after I sold the property, Stephen found a buyer who was prepared to pay $10,000 more for it. Instead of liaising with me as I was then the Marketing Agent, he contacted the owner directly. With Paul`s, who is Louis` son, help and advice, the owner refunded the 1% option money to my buyer and granted another option to purchase to Stephen`s buyer. The second option was granted one week before the expiry of the first option.
 
When I received my share of commission on 20 July 1996, I was shocked that besides the usual 20% deduction by the company, another 20% was deducted making it a total of 40%. My commission basis as stated in the agency agreement was 80%/20%.
 
 When I tried to seek an explanation from Louis on the additional 20% deduction, he threw tantrum at me saying that I was childish in depriving his son, Paul, of his rightful share of commission. Reluctantly, he said that the 20% deduction was for the following:
 
1 
 10% to Paul for his help in getting the owner to grant the second option to purchase; 
 
2 
 10% to Stephen`s friend as referral fee for recommending the buyer. 
 
 From the above, it is clear that Paul has no role in this transaction. He was neither the first nor second agent. I was completely shut off from the second transaction even though I was then the Marketing Agent. Paul was an intruder in this instance. Is he entitled to `his rightful share` as his father claimed? I was completely unaware of Stephen`s referral. Is this ethical? I shall leave to you, members of the Council to decide.
 
B Making disparaging comments and lies against another agent
 
 Please refer to Appendix III for a photocopy of Louis` article in his November 1996 company`s newsletter in which he made disparaging comments and lies about me. The article read `An example of over-confidence and greed that backfired`.
 
Although no names were mentioned, there were sufficient insinuations and innuendo in the article to suggest that I was the agent he was alluding to (very clever on his part to avoid a legal suit for defamation).
 
There is a clear reference in the first sentence of the second paragraph to a 99-year leasehold landed property. It read...
 
`First Agent was marketing this two-storey Semi-D (L99)...`
 
For the whole of 1996, Louis listed only two 99-year leasehold landed properties. Both of them were marketed and sold by me, although one was subsequently aborted. A glance at the company property listings on 14 October 1996 (please see Appendix IV) showed only one landed 99-year leasehold landed property. This listing was accessible to all agents in the company. Anyway, reference to this listing is unnecessary as I was well known in the company as a `99 years man`.
 
I was appointed the first Marketing Agent for 7A Jalan Rindu on 13 May 1996. The property was sold on 18 July 1996 for $1.6m after two months of intensive marketing. However, it was aborted on 1 August 1996, on the option expiry date. Although the buyer refused to exercise the option, he asked to be informed should the owner decides to sell at $1.45m later. I informed both Louis and the owner of the buyer`s wish to buy at a much lower price and the property was given to a second agent to market.
 
On 18 October 1996, nearly two and a half months after the aborted sale, Louis informed me that the second agent, Thomas, found a buyer for $1.448m, a far cry from the earlier sale of $1.6m. 
 He asked me to lie to the vendor that my buyer was no longer interested as he wanted the second agent to close the deal. Coincidentally, Thomas is also an old friend of Louis. Naturally, I refused to abide by his request as I spent nearly $2,000 marketing this property. Anyway, which agent would give up an opportunity to close?
 
Feeling very sore at my refusal to accede to his request, he insisted on a three-way co-broke. I was totally taken aback as the Company`s Operations Manual states very clearly that the second Marketing Agent should receive only 10% as referral token should the buyer comes from my list which was submitted earlier.
 
Now we take a post-mortem at the disparaging remarks and lies in the article. The first sentence of the third paragraph reads ...
 
`After five weeks, a buyer was identified at $1.45m.`
 
Is it true that a buyer was found after five weeks? My buyer aborted the sale on 1August 1996 and Thomas found a buyer on 18 October 1996. That is 12 weeks and not five weeks!
 
The fourth sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`Agent 1 insisted that his buyer who first made the offer of $1.45m should be given priority.`
 
It strains logic to say that where both offers were of the same price of $1.45m my buyer should be given priority over Thomas`. The truth is Thomas` buyer only offered $1.448m and not $1.45m. My buyer`s offer was $1.45m.
 
The seventh sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`This compromise to co-broke three-way was not accepted by Agent [num ]1...`
 
Of course, I did not agree as the Company`s Operations Manual stated clearly that Thomas should receive only 10% and not 33% (three-way co-broke) in the event that the buyer comes from my list. (Please see Appendix I.) I was shocked that Louis refused to abide by what he spelt out in his Operations Manual.
 
The fifth sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`As the transaction was then at a critical stage of negotiation ...`
 
I spoke to the vendor and he said he was merely considering the offer at $1.448m as it was a big drop from the earlier aborted sale of $1.6m. He laughed when I told him Louis said that it was at a critical stage of negotiation.
 
The last second sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`the commission proceeds would be split only between Lister and himself as a matter of policy.`
 
This is preposterous as Thomas stand to receive 10% as the second Marketing Agent even though the buyer comes from my list. (Please see Appendix I.)
 
The last third sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`Agent [num ]1 who claimed that he had earlier spent heavily on advertising the property.`
 
 Again this is typical of Louis. He is always derisive of other people efforts. I spent nearly $2,000 marketing this property. He should be glad that I was willing to market this 99-year leasehold property when all other agents in the company turned it down. Up to today, I still failed to understand why he is helping his crony who was in his list of agents for only one month!
 
The first sentence of fourth paragraph reads ...
 
`As agent [num ]1 was confident that his buyer would take up the sale, agent [num ]2 had to stop further discussions with his buyer and the relevant lawyers involved.`
 
 This is outrageously untrue
. The vendor was merely considering the offer at $1.45m, a drop of $150k from the previous sale. Anyway, this is a $1.45m sale of a private property, not a sale of a commercial property like Paragon where the transaction is complicated and the sum involved hundreds of millions of dollars. Lawyers need not be involved at this stage!
 
The second sentence of last paragraph reads ...
 
`This expensive experience has cost the relevant parties $21,750.00 in commission just because of personal greed and over-confidence.`
 
This is one and a half per cent commission on a sale price of $1.45m. It defy logic to say that the owner was willing to pay one and a half per cent commission on $1.45m when in the earlier aborted sale, he was willing to pay only one per cent commission on a higher sale price of $1.6m. (Please see Appendix V.)
 
 Louis Yeap is a master at the art of puffery. Let us take a look at his latest colour brochure. In it there is a testimony by Mr Cho Jock Min.
 
 I quote: `Once again, our thanks to you for selling our house in a remarkably short period of three weeks and at the price we wanted.` (Please see Appendix VI.)
 
 Mr Cho was the owner of 26 Pasir Panjang Hill, a unique five-storey corner freehold townhose [sic]. His house was sold after two months of marketing not three weeks. How did I know? I should know as I was involved in marketing his property! Mr Cho had since emigrated to Australia.

 Letter of 20 February 
 
On 20 February 1997, in response to a letter from Messrs Sim Mong Teck & Partners on the retention by the defendant of certain articles belonging to Louis Yeap Realty, the defendant replied in terms of the letter of 20 February enclosing a copy of the letter of 8 January. Both letters were carbon copied to ASR, SISV and ASREA.
 33.The letter of 20 February, with the offending words complained of underlined, read: 
...
 
Dear Sirs
 
Breach of code of conduct and ethics by Mr Louis Yeap Beng San of Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd
 
I refer to your letter dated 13 February 1997 on the subject of return of the following items belonging to Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd.
 
(1) Operations Manual 
(2) Locker Key 
(3) Identification Badge 
(4) File containing real estate agreements
 
I am shocked and dismayed that your client, Louis Yeap had the audacity to threaten to file a police report and institute legal proceedings against me for the recovery of the above items.
 
Your client`s conduct and behavior made it difficult, if not impossible for me to return the above items to him.
 
It may interest you to note that I have on 8 January 1997, filed two complaints against your client to the Association of Singapore Realtors (`ASR`).
 
 Firstly, your client conspired with his son, Paul and his old friend and agent, Stephen Pang to deprive me of approximately $900 in my share of commission on the sale of 26 Burnfoot Terrace.
 
From the attached you can see that Paul clearly has no role in this transaction. He was neither the Lister or Marketing Agent. He was, to be precise an intruder in this instance. Yet a share of my commission was diverted to him for his `intruder` status.
 
 Secondly, your client resorted to making disparaging comments and lies against me in his November 1996 company newsletter. He is the writer of the Company`s Operations Manual in which he set out meticulously the Company`s policies. I was shocked (am still shocked) that he refused to abide by what he had spelt out in his Operations Manual.
 
Please see attached a copy of my complaint to ASR.
 
It seems your client is a law unto himself. Let me give you another concrete example of a situation where he stands defiant of his company`s policies as set out in his Operations Manual.
 
Here he refused to share the expenses in respect of a first-generation property (Liberty Warehouse) in which I successfully marketed.
 
Sixth paragraph Section E-1 of his Operations Manual reads:
 
`Should any referral/listing be received as a result of the publicity on the original Listing, the Marketing Agent & Lister will be Joint Listers on the property for the `first generation referral` only (ie only for one property referred through the original Lister`s listing). For this joint listing, publicity expenses & commission received will be shared equally (50:50).`
 
By the way the total expenses, to be shared equally between Lister and Marketing Agent is $55.62. (Please see Appendix 7).
 
I shall now touch on the subject of the return of the above items to your client.
 
Identification Badge - Your client insisted that I produce the receipt for the $20 deposit before he would refund the money to me. He refused to accept that I had mislaid the receipt.
 
Rank Xerox Photocopy Card - Your client refused to refund the balance on my photocopy card amounting to over $35.
 
File containing Real Estate Agreements - What Real Estate Agreements? Please specify. The only agreement I recalled signing is when I joined the Company as an agent.
 
I have made many attempts in resolving the above outstanding issues with your client, but he has up to date refused to settle the matter. I have no recourse but to resort to ASR for mediation.
 
Despite your client`s threat to file a police report and institute legal proceedings against me for the recovery of the above items, I will continue to exercise restraint and refrain from taking legal action unless I am forced to.
 
As regards the Operations Manual, your client still refused to accept that I had mislaid it. In the above instance, I quote from my ex-colleague`s Operations Manual. Please assure your client that I will return the Manual together with the other items as soon as I locate it.
 
Thank you for your understanding.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Signed

 The proceedings 
 
On 9 April 1997, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings. On the plaintiff`s claim, the issues were: (i). were the offending words defamatory of the plaintiff;
 (ii). if they were, were they true;
 (iii). alternatively, were the offending words fair comment or were they published on an occasion of qualified privilege;
 (iv). if it was, was it actuated by malice?
 On the defendant`s counterclaim, the issues were: (i). was the newsletter defamatory;
 (ii). if it was, could it be read and identified as referring to the defendant;
 (iii). if it could, were the contents in substance true?
 (iv). alternatively, was it published on an occasion of qualified privilege or fair comment.
 35.
 The plaintiff`s claim 
 
Whether the offending words are defamatory is one of construction according to their natural and ordinary meaning. See 
Lee Kuan Yew v Davies & Ors
 
[1989] SLR 1063
 at 1080
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 390
  at 399 per LP Thean J [as he then was]: 
I now turn to consider the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of in para 9 in the context of the article ...
 
The issue is one purely of construction of the words, but the rules of construction applicable in construing a contract or a will are not appropriate for the purpose. The proper approach is to consider what meaning the words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons: ...
 36.I now give my construction of the natural and ordinary meaning of the offending words in the context in which they appeared: 
`Breach of code of conduct and ethics by Louis Yeap Beng San of Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd.
 
I have several grievances against Mr Louis Yeap, a respected and senior member of your Association.
 
Generally, the level of professionalism in the industry today is rock bottom. I have no wish to report him to IRAS, the licensing body for the Housing Agents at this moment in time as I believe that you have the power to discipline an errant member.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was unethical in his conduct as a licensed housing agent and had breached the code of conduct and ethics for housing agents.
 37.
`When I tried to seek an explanation from Louis on the additional 20% deduction, he threw a tantrum at me saying that I was childish in depriving his son, Paul of his rightful share of the commission. Reluctantly, he said that the 20% deduction was for the following:
 
1 10% to Paul for his help in getting the owner to grant the second option to purchaser. 
2 10% to Stephen`s friend as referral fee for recommending the buyer. From the above, it is clear that Paul has no role in this transaction. He was neither the first nor second Agent. I was completely shut off from the second transaction even though I was then the Marketing Agent. Paul was an intruder in this instance. Is he entitled to `his rightful share` as his father claimed? I was completely unaware of Stephen`s referral. Is this ethical? I shall leave to you, members of the Council to decide.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff conspired with Stephen Pang and his son Paul Yeap to deprive the defendant of his rightful share of the commission and also that the plaintiff had lied to the defendant in order to give Paul Yeap the 10% commission which the latter was not entitled to.
 38.
`Please refer to Appendix III for a photocopy of Louis` article in his November 1996 company`s newsletter in which he made disparaging comments and lies about me. The article read ""An example of over-confidence and greed that backfired"".`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was a liar and had unjustifiably disparaged the defendant in the newsletter.
 39.
`He asked me to lie to the vendor that my buyer was no longer interested as he wanted the second agent to close the deal. Coincidentally, Thomas is also an old friend of Louis. Naturally, I refused to abide by his request as I spent nearly $2,000 marketing this property. Anyway, which agent would give up an opportunity to close?`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff resorted to unethical means to ensure that his old friend Thomas Tham close the deal in place of the defendant who had incurred close to $2,000 in advertisements.
 40.
`Again this is typical of Louis. He is always derisive of other people`s efforts. I spent nearly $2,000 marketing this property. He should be glad that I was willing to market this 99-year leasehold property when all other agents in the company turned it down. Up to today, I still fail to understand why he is helping his crony who was in his list of agents for only one month!`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff never gave credit when it was due and that he favoured his crony Thomas Tham.
 41.
`This is outrageously untrue.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff had published lies in the newsletter about the defendant`s conduct in the sale of 7A Jalan Rindu.
 42.
`Louis Yeap is a master at the art of puffery. Let us take a look at his latest colour brochure. In it there is a testimony by Mr Cho Jock Min.
 
I quote: ""once again, our thanks to you for selling our house in a remarkably short period of three weeks and at the price we wanted."" Mr Cho was the owner of 26 Pasir Panjang Hill, a unique five-storey corner freehold townhouse. His house was sold after two months of marketing not three weeks. How did I know? I should know as I was involved in marketing his property! Mr Cho had since emigrated to Australia.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff is a master in exaggeration and had been deceitful in the publication of the testimony of Cho Jock Min.
 43.
`Firstly, your client conspired with his son, Paul and his old friend and agent, Stephen Pang to deprive me of approximately $900 in my share of commission on the sale of 26 Burnfoot Terrace.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff conspired with his son Paul Yeap and his old friend Stephen Pang to deprive the defendant of his full share of the commission.
 44.
`Secondly, your client resorted to making disparaging comments and lies against me in his November 1996 company newsletter.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff is a liar and made disparaging remarks against the defendant in the newsletter.
 45.
`He is the writer of the Company`s Operations Manual in which he set out meticulously the company`s policies. I was shocked (am still shocked) that he refused to abide by what he had spelt out in his Operation Manual.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was a hypocrite and did not practise what he preached.
 46.I was therefore of the view that the offending words were defamatory of the plaintiff.
 47.Against the factual background of the sale of the four properties, the offending words are not true in substance and in fact. Accordingly the defence of justification failed.
 48.On the defence of fair comment, the comment must be based on a correct substratum of facts. Statements like `Again this is typical of Louis`; `This is outrageously untrue`; `Louis is a master at the art of puffery` could be comments but they were not based on a correct substratum of facts. The defence of fair comment therefore failed.
 49.On qualified privilege, 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed) p 329, para 14.5 states: 
The occasions (of qualified) privilege can never be catalogued and rendered exact` but most privileged occasions under the common law may be very broadly classified into one of two classes: where the maker of the statement has a duty (whether legal, social or moral) to make the statement and the recipient has a corresponding interest to receive it; or where the maker of the statement is acting in pursuance of an interest of his and the recipient has such a corresponding interest or duty in relation to the statement or where he is acting in a matter in which he has a common interest with the recipient. `It may be accepted as a well-established rule that some duty or interest must exist in the party to whom the communication is made as well as in the party making it. The duty or interest may be common to both parties, but this is not essential. It is enough if there is a duty or interest on one side, and a duty or interest, or interest or duty (whether common or corresponding or not) on the other.`
 It is not clear as to what interest ASR and its members, SISV and ASREA have in the letter of 8 January and letter of 20 February addressed to them by the defendant. The licensing body for real estate agents is the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. In any case, although the plaintiff is a member of ASR and ASREA, he is not a member of SISV. SISV therefore can have no interest in the publication.
 50.Additionally `malice defeats the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment.` See 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
, p 424, para 16.1. See also p 427 at para 16.4: 
 Malice as `improper` or `indirect` motive
. The plaintiff will succeed in proving the existence of express malice if he can show that the defendant was not using the occasion honestly for the purpose for which the law gives protection. But was actuated by some indirect motive not connected with the privilege.
 51.The publication was clearly actuated by malice on the part of the defendant. This was what the defendant said under cross-examination: 
Q: You said you cc this letter addressed to us [referring to plaintiff`s solicitors] to ASR, SISV and ASREA because we threatened to lodge a police report for loss of items belonging to the company which were in your possession or custody? 
A: Yes. That is one of the reasons. Another reason is plaintiff is petty. See PBD/87. He refused to refund me my $20 unless I produced the deposit receipt. Another reason is Rank Xerox photocopy card. He refused to refund my money for the stored value card which card was returned to him. Another reason he refused to pay me $27.81 for plaintiff`s share in some advertisements.
 52.Accordingly I found for the plaintiff and awarded him $40,000 by way of damages and costs.
 53.On the defendant`s counterclaim, the newsletter was an in-house publication. Circulation was confined to the agents of Louis Yeap Realty. It was based on the abortive sale of the leasehold property at 7A Jalan Rindu. The defendant was not named. He was one of the five agents who had marketed this property unsuccessfully. With such a limited circulation and with five marketing agents involved in this property, only those with knowledge of the facts would have read the newsletter as published of the defendant. See 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed) p 163, para 7.3: 
 Statement capable of referring to the plaintiff.
 The statement must `identify` the plaintiff, that is to say, it must be capable of referring to him. The issue of identification is to be decided on principles similar to those which govern the question of whether the words are capable of a defamatory meaning. Where the plaintiff is expressly identified by name, it is not necessary to produce evidence to prove that anyone to whom the statement was published did identify the plaintiff. The question is not whether anyone did identify the plaintiff but whether persons who were acquainted with the plaintiff could identify him from the words used. Thus if a local newspaper in Cornwall publishes a false story to the effect that `John Smith of 24 Acacia Avenue, Carlisle, has been convicted of fraud` that is actionable by John Smith even though there is no evidence that anyone who knew him read the story. Where the plaintiff is referred to in an indirect way or by implication it will be a question of degree how far evidence will be required to connect the libel with him. At one extreme, if there is a libel on `the Prime Minister` that officer does not need to produce witnesses to testify that they know who he is. 
 At the other extreme, the plaintiff may only be identifiable by reason of extrinsic facts which are not generally known, in which case there is no actionable publication unless it is shown that the words were communicated to persons with such knowledge. Even in the latter type of case, however, it is not enough that the recipients of the statement did understand it to refer to the plaintiff: the issue is whether reasonable people with their knowledge would so understand it
. [Emphasis added.]
 54.In 
 Consolidated Trust Co Ltd v Browne 
 (1948) 49 SR(NSW) 86, a cyclostyled statement prepared by the defendant headed `Things I hear. For the confidential information of subscribers, a privately circulated digest for busy people.` The only persons defamed were identified as `the new owners of a block of flats, 57 Darlinghurst Road, who owned Birtley Towers as well.`
 55.The plaintiff`s action was dismissed. In dismissing the plaintiff`s appeal Jordan CJ stated at pp 91-92: 
The article complained of contained matter capable of being regarded as defamatory of persons of whose identity the only indication given in the article is that they are `the new owners (of 57 Darlinghurst Road) who own Birtley Towers as well`. It was proved in evidence that one of the plaintiffs owned 57 Darlinghurst Road and the other owned Birtley Towers. But the only evidence of publication was an admission that the defendant published the matter complained of, it not being stated how or to whom. This was evidently not intended, and in argument has not been treated, as an admission that the article came to the notice of someone who knew that one plaintiff was the owner of 57 Darlinghurst Road and the other the owner of Birtley Towers (and therefore allegedly also the owner of 57 Darlinghurst Road). It was treated as an admission only that the article came to the notice of at least some one person. The argument submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs is that so long as it is a legitimate inference from the facts that some people must have known that the plaintiffs were the owners of these premises respectively, it was unnecessary to prove that the article came to the notice of at least one of these people. In the absence of anything in the evidence to suggest that the identity of the owners of the buildings in question was a matter of such general notoriety that it could fairly be presumed that anybody to whose notice the article came would know who it was that was referred to as the owner, I am of the opinion that this argument is unsound. The position then is that the article is incapable of being regarded as defamatory of the plaintiffs except by persons who had knowledge of special circumstances, namely, that one of them owned one block of flats and the other another, and there is no evidence that it was published to anyone who possess that knowledge.
 There is no evidence that the newsletter was circulated to persons with knowledge of the facts relating to the abortive sale of 7A Jalan Rindu and that reasonable people with knowledge of the facts would understand it to refer to the defendant.
 56.Alternatively, the contents of the newsletter are true and the plaintiff is entitled to rely on the defence of justification. There was a slight inaccuracy in the statement that the second agent, that is Stephen Pang, found a buyer at $1,450,000. He found a buyer at only $1,448,000. Such slight inaccuracy does not disentitle the plaintiff to the defence of justification. See Gatley supra at p 239, para 11.8: 
 Inaccuracy of detail.
 Again, if the defendant can prove that the main charge or gist of the libel is true, a slight inaccuracy in one or more of its details will not prevent him from succeeding in a defence of justification.
 57.It was my view that the publication was also protected by the alternative defence of fair comment and qualified privilege.
 58.Accordingly, I dismissed the defendant`s counterclaim with costs.","1999-02-08 00:00:00","SG High Court"

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KARTHIGESU JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 18 years and caning with 24 strokes for the offence of robbery punishable under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) by Choo Han Teck JC. He appealed against the sentence. We reduced the term of imprisonment to 12 years and confirmed the imposition of the punishment of caning with 24 strokes. We now give our reasons.
 2.
 The facts 
 
The appellant, Roslan bin Abdul Rahman, had an accomplice, Ali bin Abdullah. The deceased victim was one Chia Siew Hiew, a 74 year old woman. Prior to her demise, she resided alone in Blk 45 Bedok South Road [num ]10-791.
 3.Sometime in June 1997, the appellant was in desperate need of cash. The accomplice suggested to the appellant that he should steal from the deceased. He informed the appellant that the deceased would water her plants outside her flat at a particular time every morning and that the appellant could sneak into her flat at that time. The appellant then observed the behaviour of the deceased and found that there was indeed such a pattern.
 4.On 23 June 1997, the appellant, acting on the accomplice`s suggestion, sneaked into the deceased`s flat whilst she was watering her plants and hid in her bedroom. When the deceased returned to her bedroom, she spotted the appellant and started screaming. She tried to escape but the appellant grabbed her. The appellant then used his hands to cover her mouth and dragged her back into the room.
 5.When the appellant released her, she attempted to escape from the room again. A struggle ensued and in the course of the struggle, the deceased fell and hit her face against the edge of the bed and the floor. She suffered bruises on her cheeks and forehead, as well as some fractures around the area of her right eye and her nose. She lost consciousness but was (according to the appellant) still alive.
 6.The appellant took a small towel and stuffed it into her mouth to stop her from screaming when she regained consciousness. He ransacked the room and stole about $4,000 in cash, two gold rings and a gold bracelet. The appellant then wiped everything he had touched with one of his socks before leaving the flat.
 7.On 24 June 1998, the adopted son of the deceased discovered her and called the police. The deceased was subsequently pronounced dead. On 25 June 1998, a post-mortem revealed the cause of death was asphyxia due to gagging.
 8.On 6 July 1998, the appellant was charged as follows: 
That you, Roslan bin Abdul Rahman, on 23 June 1997, at or about 6am, at Block 45, Bedok South Road [num ]10-791, Singapore, did commit robbery of the following properties:
 
(i) cash of $4,000, 
(ii) two gold rings valued at $50 each, and 
(iii) one gold bracelet valued at $150,
 
with a total value of $4,250, in possession of one Chia Siew Hiew, and whilst committing the said robbery, did cause grievous hurt to the said Chia Siew Hiew, to wit, by causing her to suffer fractures around the area of her right eye and on her nose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 The appellant pleaded guilty to the above charge.
 9.
 The decision below 
 
The appellant was not represented by counsel at the trial below. The appellant admitted the offence and the statement of facts which was read out. He pleaded for leniency. The deputy public prosecutor then addressed the court and pressed for a deterrent sentence. In his address the deputy public prosecutor drew the court`s attention to the appellant`s antecedents, all of which related to the consumption of drugs and detentions at drug rehabilitation centres. He drew attention to the particular facts of this case where the appellant had preyed on a very old woman who was quite helpless in defending herself and referred to police statistics which showed that property offences involving victims of 60 years and above were on the increase. Finally, the deputy public prosecutor submitted that there was a correlation between an accused person`s drug background and the crime committed by them. He referred to certain statistics in support and after referring in detail to the appellant`s `long history of drug abuse` and detentions at drug rehabilitation centres which went as far back as 1977, concluded his address to the court on sentence with these words: 
The accused has therefore maintained his drug activities throughout the last 20 years and because of the correlation between such a background and the commission of property offences ..., offenders like him must be deterred effectively by meting out a harsh sentence.
 The appellant was then sentenced to imprisonment for the term of 18 years and caning with 24 strokes in accordance with s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 10.
 The appeal 
 
On appeal, the appellant, who appeared in person, contended that the trial judge erred in taking into consideration his drug-related antecedents and that the sentence pronounced was manifestly excessive.
 11.The applicable laws are s 394 and s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). For easy reference, we have set out the provisions below.Section 394 of the Penal Code reads: 
Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery.
 
394 If any person, in committing or in attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and any other person, jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 stokes.
 Section 397 of the Penal Code reads: 
Robbery when armed or with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.
 
397 If at the time of committing or attempting to commit robbery, the offender is armed with or uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, such offender shall be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes, in addition to any other punishment to which he may be liable under any other section of this Code.
 12.The offence of committing armed robbery with hurt, with which the appellant was charged, carried the punishment of a mandatory minimum caning of 24 strokes under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code. The combined effect of these two provisions effectively removed the court`s discretion to decrease the number of strokes of the cane. It followed that this part of the appeal naturally failed. In passing it will be remembered that under s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code the maximum number of strokes of the cane permitted is 24. Hence in this case the minimum number of strokes was also the maximum.
 13.The next issue was whether we should reduce the term of imprisonment. In the present case the learned trial judge was right to regard the offence of armed robbery with hurt as a very serious offence meriting a deterrent sentence due to the prevalence of this type of offence.
 14.The learned trial judge gave no reasons in support of the sentence he imposed. The appellant`s final plea was that this was his first criminal offence as the others were drug-related offences. This plea was ignored. It seemed to us that the learned trial judge was influenced by the prosecution`s submission and took into account the appellant`s drug-related antecedents. The learned trial judge had proceeded on wrong principles. The appellant`s drug-related antecedents should have no bearing on the present trial as it was completely unrelated to the offence the appellant was charged with. The appellant had no antecedents of offences related to the type of offence he was charged with. The fact that the appellant was a drug addict did not necessarily imply that he was more prone to commit the offence of armed robbery with hurt.
 15.Bearing this in mind, we considered the sentence of 18 years` imprisonment to be inappropriate and unduly excessive. We therefore quashed that sentence and substituted for it a sentence of 12 years` imprisonment. Accordingly, the sentence was reduced to 12 years` imprisonment and caning with 24 strokes.","1999-02-01 00:00:00","SG Court of Appeal"

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant claimed trial in the district court to 23 amended charges of abetment of cheating under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and one amended charge of abetment of attempted cheating under s 420 read with ss 109 and 511. At the close of the trial, he was convicted by the district judge. He also elected to plead guilty to a charge of affray under s 160 of the Penal Code, which had been stood down during the trial of the cheating charges. Having heard his mitigation plea, the district judge sentenced him to nine years` preventive detention. The appellant appealed against this sentence as being manifestly excessive. I dismissed his appeal and, further, exercised my discretion under s 256(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code to enhance the sentence to one of 20 years` preventive detention. I now give my reasons in writing.
 2.
 The background facts 
 
By way of background, I set out below the first of the 24 cheating charges to which the appellant claimed trial. This first charge serves as a sample of the other charges, as all 24 charges alleged largely similar acts: 
You, Heng Jong Cheng, M/57 years, NRIC No S1091887A are charged that you, on or about 25 October 1997, at about 10am, at Blk 846, Yishun Ring Road, [num ]01-3667, M/s First Pawnshop Pte Ltd, Singapore, did abet one Chua Mei Chern by instigating her to cheat one Wong Ngiam Khong by taking a silver bracelet plated with gold and pawning it as a gold bracelet to the said Wong Ngiam Khong for the value of $1,550, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Wong Ngiam Khong to deliver to the said Chua Mei Chern the said sum of $1,550, which he would not have done so had he not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 3.The other charges differed mainly in terms of the particulars as to the date and place of the offence, the identity of the victim and the amount of money involved. In committing these offences, the appellant had two accomplices, one Chua Mei Chern and one Loy Hui Huat. Both Chua and Loy were approached by the appellant to assist him in the scam. The scheme called for Chua and Loy to visit various pawnshops with silver bracelets which had been gold-plated and which they represented to the pawnshop operators as solid gold bracelets. The proceeds received from the pawnshops were apparently turned over to the appellant who then paid off Chua and Loy for their pains.
 4.The appellant, for his part, denied any involvement in the whole scam and claimed to have been `wrongfully` accused. At the close of the trial, the district judge found the evidence against the appellant `overwhelming` and convicted him accordingly.
 5.As for the affray charge, to which the appellant pleaded guilty, this involved a fight between the appellant and the male accomplice Loy at a void deck.
 6.
 The appellant`s mitigation and antecedents 
 
In making his mitigation plea after his conviction, the appellant referred to his age as well as the poor health of his wife. He also said that he had not committed any offence since his last conviction in court in 1993 and added that he had `turned over a new leaf`. This attempt to portray himself as a reformed character was somewhat hampered by the revelation of a lengthy list of antecedents to which he himself admitted. These antecedents indicated an illustrious career in crime, spanning over three decades and encompassing, in particular, numerous offences involving dishonesty. As an example, I need set out only those convictions sustained in the 1990s. In February 1991 the appellant was convicted of two charges of housebreaking and theft by night. A third, similar charge was taken into consideration and he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 24 months` imprisonment each. Shortly after having completed these terms of imprisonment, the appellant made another appearance in the district court in 1993, charged on this occasion with 15 counts of assisting in the concealment or disposal of stolen property. He was eventually convicted of three out of these 15 counts, with the remaining charges being taken into consideration during sentencing. Three terms of imprisonment were imposed, each of a duration of two years and six months; and two of these terms ran consecutively. This meant that the appellant had been out of prison for only a short period of time before he took to the cheating scam described in the preceding paragraphs.
 7.
 The appeal 
 
On appeal before me, despite this being an appeal against sentence only, the appellant repeated the same allegations he had made in the trial below: namely, that he had not committed any of the cheating offences; and that he had been `fixed up` by Loy who owed him money over horse-racing bets. I had no hesitation in dismissing these allegations. They were considered by the district judge in the course of a three-day trial in which the appellant was afforded every opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses, including Loy. The district judge eventually concluded that the appellant`s allegations of a `fix-up` were baseless and I found nothing at all in the evidence to suggest otherwise. If anything, the appellant`s continued protestations of a `fix-up` demonstrated an obstinate refusal to accept responsibility for the offences committed. The only other thing he had to say in support of his appeal was that he would `turn over a new leaf`, which claim I found difficult, if not impossible, to believe.
 8.I was faced, then, with an offender who had evinced a complete lack of remorse and whose record indicated that he was highly likely to return to a life of crime once he was released from detention. His various encounters with the criminal law since 1958 appeared to have taught him nothing. Even on occasions where he was merely fined for offences such as the dishonest receipt of stolen property, he failed to take advantage of the `second chance` given: indeed, if his record was anything to go by, he went on to thumb his nose at the law by committing almost exactly the same kind of offences in an even greater number. Having attained the age of 57 years, he had apparently managed to avoid learning any useful skills other than those of a habitual criminal. Shortly before the perpetration of the cheating scam in 1997, he was (on his own evidence) operating as an illegal bookmaker.
 9.Having regard to the above factors, I found the appellant`s appeal against sentence to be without merit. In fact, far from being manifestly excessive, a term of nine years` preventive detention appeared to me to be manifestly inadequate to protect the public from the menace constituted by the appellant. Given the average life expectancy of an adult man these days, even if the appellant is released from detention at age 66, he would have a good number of years left in which to make mischief; and if, after a lifetime spent in and out of the criminal courts, he had made no effort to quell his criminal inclinations at age 57, I had grave doubts that he would do so even after being released at age 66. Moreover, one could scarcely affect a dewy-eyed optimism about the sort of opportunities which would be available to the appellant on re-entering society at age 66. As I have pointed out, he appeared to have no useful skills with which to support himself; and once released at age 66, with his record of previous convictions, it was highly improbable that he would find a foothold in the competitive workplace of today. Left to his own devices, it seemed to me he might well find himself floundering in poorer conditions than those prevailing in detention; and this, in turn, would only fuel his tendency towards unlawful means of livelihood.
 10.In the circumstances, I considered a protracted period of preventive detention to be in the best interests not only of the public but also of the appellant himself. Accordingly, I dismissed his appeal and enhanced the period of preventive detention to the maximum term of 20 years.","1999-03-16 00:00:00","SG High Court"

This was an appeal against the decision of the assistant registrar given on 9 March 1987 in which, on an application under O 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court by the plaintiffs for judgment, he gave the defendants unconditional leave to defend the action.
The plaintiffs` claim is for a sum of $340,818.67, being the balance of the price of diamonds and gems sold and delivered by the plaintiffs to the defendants. There was no dispute on the amount owing, as the defendants admitted the claim. However, the defendants contended that the contracts for the sale of diamonds and gems to them were tainted with illegality and the illegality arose in this way. The plaintiffs were well aware that the diamonds and gems sold to the defendants were meant for sale in Peninsular Malaysia and that they were to be taken there without any declaration and payment of customs duty due to the Malaysian authority. The defendants maintained that the modus operandi in the sale and delivery of the diamonds was `a joint illegal enterprise` and a director of the plaintiffs, Pradip Ramanlal Shah, `knew and was privy to this joint illegal enterprise`. That was the only defence raised and it was submitted on behalf of the defendants that that was a triable issue. The learned assistant registrar, who heard the application, gave unconditional leave to the defendants to defend the action and against that decision, the appeal was brought. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, I varied the decision of the learned assistant registrar and ordered that leave be given to the defendants to defend the action on condition that the defendants furnished a bank guarantee for the sum of $340,818.67 within 21 days from the date thereof, in default of which the plaintiffs would be at liberty to enter final judgment against the defendants for the sum claimed with interest and costs.
In seeking to set up the defence of illegality, Mohamed Yusoof s/o Mohamed Dawood, a director of the defendants, in his affidavit affirmed on 4 November 1986 said, inter alia, as follows: 
 
9 The plaintiffs were well aware that the diamonds and gems sold to the defendants were meant for sale in Peninsular Malaysia.
 
 
 
 
(10) The plaintiffs were well aware that the said diamonds and gems were being taken into Peninsular Malaysia without declaration and payment of the customs dues due to the Malaysian authorities. 
 
(11) The modus operandi of the sale and delivery between the plaintiffs and defendants was a joint illegal enterprise. The said Pradip Ramanlal Shah knew and was privy to this joint illegal enterprise.
  
 
 
Mohamed Yusoof then proceeded to show how he took delivery of the diamonds and gems from the plaintiffs. He said that he went to the plaintiffs` premises, collected the diamonds and gems under consignment notes, and then brought them to Malaysia and sold them there, and that those, which were unsold were returned to the plaintiffs, who would then invoice and bill the defendants only for those diamonds and gems which were sold. That was the modus operandi in the sale of all the diamonds comprised in the 13 invoices set out in para 1 of the statement of claim, except for five lots of diamonds, in respect of which, he said this: 
 
21 As suggested and advised by Pradip Ramanlal Shah these lots were exported legally from Singapore into Peninsular Malaysia in order to give an air of legality to the entire transactions. When they were so exported the packing was done in the plaintiffs` office under the supervision of Pradip Ramanlal Shah. The preparation of all the documents for the export was also done by the plaintiffs but on the defendants` invoices. This was done by the plaintiffs` clerk named Nadirah.
 
 
 
He then said that the plaintiffs were fully aware of the entire transaction and that the diamonds and gems were smuggled into Peninsular Malaysia for sale there.
An examination of the allegations contained in the affidavit does not really show that there was `a joint illegal enterprise` and that the plaintiffs were `privy to this joint illegal enterprise`. The defendants admitted there were sales of diamonds and gems to them and that the sales were on consignment: the plaintiffs billed for only those items sold by the defendants. The sales and delivery took place in Singapore. They were exported by the defendants to Malaysia for sale by them, and in taking them across to Malaysia the defendants committed the illegal acts under the laws there: they smuggled the diamonds and gems into Malaysia without payment of customs duty. There was no suggestion that the plaintiffs` servants or agents in any way took part in the smuggling or assisted in the smuggling. The plaintiffs might be well aware of such illegal acts of the defendants, their servants or agents. But mere knowledge on the part of the plaintiffs that the diamonds and gems sold to the defendants would be exported illegally by the defendants to Malaysia does not constitute a defence to the claim by the plaintiffs.

The defendant, on an application under O 14, claimed that it was an express term of the contract that the goods would be invoiced as `parts for a rolling mill`, and the purpose, as the plaintiffs well knew, was to cause a false invoice to be put up so as to enable the press extrusion plant to be imported to Lebanon contrary to Lebanese law. The defendant therefore claimed that the contract was tainted with illegality. This defence was dismissed on an application under O 14 and leave to defend on this point was refused. The refusal on this ground was confirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal. Lord Denning said that in order for such a defence to succeed, the d efendant must show two things: he must show, firstly, that the contract contained a term that the English manufacturers were to give a false invoice, and, secondly, that the English company were implicated in illegality in that they had knowledge of it and actively participated in it. He said, at p 362: 
 
In the second place, even if it were a term, the defendant would have to show that the English company were implicated in this illegality, that is, that they had knowledge of it and were actively participating in it: see

 referred to by Lord Denning, is as follows: 
 
... In my view the present position of the law is that the mere fact that a vendor of goods knows that the purchaser proposes to run them into a country where they are prohibited by some revenue law is not sufficient to render the contract of sale illegal, but if beyond mere knowledge the vendor actively engages in an adventure to get the goods into such country, the Court will not assist the parties to the adventure by entertaining or settling any dispute between the parties arising out of the contract.
 
 
 
In the circumstances, having examined the allegations made by Mohamed Yusoof s/o Mohamed Dawood in his affidavits, there was really little or no substance in the suggested defence. The allegations by him of the `joint illegal enterprise` and of the plaintiffs being `privy to this joint illegal enterprise` were merely bald statements without any facts or evidence to support them. This is almost one of those cases where summary judgment should be ordered. However, in order not to shut the defendants out from such defence, I gave to the defendants conditional leave to defend.
As regards the condition I imposed, I do not think it is unfair or unreasonable to the defendants. They are still carrying on a diamond business and they or their directors should be able to arrange for a bank guarantee. There was no evidence that they could not do so. They had taken the diamonds and gems from the plaintiffs and had sold them, and had the benefit of such sales.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This was an appeal from the decision of Rajah J wherein he found the appellants wholly liable for the injuries suffered by the respondent while at work in the course of her employment in the laundry room at the appellants` hotel. At the end of the hearing, we dismissed the appeal for the reasons that appear below. 
 The facts 
The facts of this case may be stated shortly. The respondent had been educated in a Chinese school which she had left after completing her secondary four education. She then went through a series of jobs, none of which required much skill, before joining the appellants in July 1977 as a laundry operator. At the date of the accident on 17 June 1983 she was about 34 years of age.
The appellants` hotel employed about 40 laundry operators who were divided into two sections, namely, the washing and the ironing sections. The respondent was employed in the latter and her duties included the ironing of bedsheets, pillow cases, towels and clothes. The laundry operators were also divided into senior and junior operators and at the time of the accident the respondent was considered a senior operator. The operators were supervised by a laundry supervisor who in turn reported to the manager in charge of the laundry room. The laundry manager was assisted on the technical side by an assistant engineer who in turn was assisted by two laundry technicians.
The respondent did her ironing work on pressing machines and there were several different models in the laundry room and they were all operated differently. According to the respondent, she did not receive any formal training when she joined the appellants. She was not placed on any training course nor was she given any instructions by the supervisor as to how to operate the machines. She learnt on the job from her fellow operators and this method of training workers continued right up to the date of the accident, with the respondent, as a senior operator, having some responsibility for training new operators. The allegation of the lack of formal training for laundry operators was denied by one Baldev Singh who was the laundry manager at the material time. He had joined the appellants in 1973 as a trainee supervisor and had been promoted to an assistant laundry manager by 1975. He then left to join another hotel before rejoining the appellants in 1981 as a laundry manager. According to him, all new operators who joined the appellants in 1977 were placed on a two-week training programme conducted by the supervisor or the manager. The learned judge did not indicate which version he believed. In view of the fact that Baldev Singh was not employed by the appellants when the respondent joined the hotel in 1977, we were inclined to prefer the respondent`s evidence as to the lack of formal training for operators. We also found it crucial, for reasons that appear below, that, even if the version given by Baldev Singh was true, the formal training was sadly lacking in the important aspect of educating the laundry operators on the safe operation of the pressing machine. Baldev Singh said in his evidence: 
 
... We normally do not highlight the safety features of the machines because they come with safety features. Because of the presence of safety features we do not tell them what not to do. We teach them to operate the machine.
 
 
 
The accident occurred when the respondent was pressing a T-shirt on a hot steam press machine made by a company known as Ibis Hoffman (`the laundry press`). In order to press a T-shirt, the respondent would normally have placed it on the top of the ironing board and then lowered a cover piece known as the head buck on to the ironing board. As designed by the manufacturer, the head buck would be lowered when two black buttons on the right side of the laundry press were simultaneously depressed together with a green button on the left side. This simultaneous action kept both of the operator`s hands away from the ironing board as the head buck was lowered and prevented any possibility of the operator`s hands coming into contact with the head buck. This was important as the head buck was heated and it was not disputed that the three button system was the safety feature of the laundry press machines. After the head buck was lowered, the operator would then release steam by using either a hand pedal or a foot pedal or both. After pressing the garment, the operator would release the head buck by depressing a red button on the side of the machine.
Unfortunately, as we shall see later, this system as designed by the manufacturer had been altered and, on the day of the accident, when she had placed the T-shirt on the top of the ironing board and was smoothening out the material with her right hand, the head buck came down suddenly. The heat of the head buck scalded her right hand badly. Her efforts to raise the head buck by pressing the release button failed as that button would only work if the head buck was flat on the top of the affixed piece. As a result, the respondent`s hand was stuck under the head buck for around ten minutes and the consequential injury has substantially reduced the function of her right hand. It was also said that the respondent was self-conscious of the disfigured hand and suffered from reactive depression and a severely restricted social life as a result.
The respondent subsequently brought this action against the appellants for damages for the injuries suffered, alleging that the injuries were caused by an unsafe system. This unsafe system was said to have been brought about by an alteration to the original two-handed operation (described above) of the laundry press and this alteration was alleged to have been in breach of the appel` common law duties as employers in that they had:
 
 
(a) failed to take any or any adequate precautions for the respondent`s safety at work; 
 
(b) exposed the respondent to a risk of injury they had or ought to have foreseen; 
 
(c) caused the alteration that resulted in an unsafe system; 
 
(d) allowed the laundry press to be operated when it was unsafe to do so; or 
 
(e) failed to provide a safe or proper system of work.
  
 
 
Further, or alternatively, the respondent alleged that the appellants were in breach of the statutory duties imposed on them by the equivalent of the present ss 20, 21 and 22 of the Factories Act (Cap 104) (`the Act`).
In their defence, the appellants denied that the system of work they provided to the respondent was unsafe. They also denied all knowledge of the alteration and alleged that if the system of work had been altered, it had been altered without their authority, and the respondent was one of the workers who caused or consented to the alteration. Further, or alternatively, the appellants contended that the respondent had been contributorily negligent and/or in breach of her statutory duty under the present ss 80 and 81 of the Act. The appellants also pleaded the defence of volenti non fit injuria.
The evidence as to the alteration to the laundry press was that sometime in February 1983, several of the laundry operators had approached one Michael Tan, one of the laundry technicians, to see if he could alter the laundry press to make it work faster. He complied but reverted to the original system a few days later when the pneumatic compressor on the modified press did not work properly. Subsequently, two or three months before the accident, he again altered the laundry press at the request of several operators by rewiring it so that the head buck would be lowered by depressing only the red button, thus enabling the laundry press to be operated with only one hand, leaving the other hand free. Under the altered system, the head buck would be released when one of the black buttons was depressed. The laundry press was operated by this altered system at the time of the accident. The evidence also showed that although the respondent was not one of the workers who requested the alteration, she knew of it and had worked the altered operation on many occasions before the accident without any discomfort.
The learned judge found the appellants to have been in breach of their duty to maintain a safe system of work. In his view, they could not delegate their duty to Michael Tan and they would have discovered the alteration had they exercised proper care and supervision. In the learned judge`s words: 
 
The alteration to the safe system had taken place two or three months before the accident. There were two or three supervisors and yet they were not aware that the machine had been tampered with. They did not stop the plaintiff [the respondent] from operating [the] machine. I think they ought to have known that the machine was defective.
 
 
 
The learned judge rejected the defences of contributory negligence and volenti non fit injuria and accordingly found the appellants wholly liable and gave the respondent interlocutory judgment, with damages to be assessed if the parties could not agree on the quantum of damages. The appellants appealed to this court.
 Contributory negligence
At the hearing before us, the appellants did not seek to dispute the question of liability. Their appeal was solely against the learned judge`s rejection of their claim that the respondent was in some way contributorily negligent. Counsel for the appellants contended that a reasonable person in the respondent`s position would have acted differently in that a reasonable person would have reported the alteration by Michael Tan to the manager of the laundry room. Counsel also sought to show that because the respondent had continued working on the laundry press despite knowing that the altered operation was dangerous, it was an inevitable conclusion that she had been contributorily negligent.
We were unable to accept the assertion that the respondent knew that the modified operation was dangerous. The relevant portion of the evidence as to her state of knowledge occurred in her evidence in cross-examination and this read: 
 
After the modification in February 1983 I had used the modified machine. Except for the modification the functions of the machine were the same. I just carried on with the work. I did not feel discomfort operating the modified machine. As the machine was working well, I was happy to use it. My other colleagues were also operating the machine. We had no complaint about the modification ... The safest method is to use both hands before the head buck could come down or be released. Under the first [ie unmodified] system I would have to use both hands to release the head buck. Under the modified system I did not have to use both hands simultaneously. So it was unsafe and dangerous ... I did not find out why the modification was done. I did not then know it was dangerous not to work on both hands.
 
 
 
It was our view that a fair reading of the quoted passages showed that it was only on hindsight that the respondent knew that the modified operation was dangerous. In addition to the language of the quoted passages, it was also significant that the safety feature of the laundry press had never been highlighted to the operators in general and the respondent in particular. This was clear from the lack of formal training or, alternatively, from the failure of the appellants, as shown by the evidence of Baldev Singh, to educate the operators on the safety features of the machines on which they did their work. Since the respondent had never known the safety feature of the machine, she could not possibly have realized that it had been removed. We should further add that there was a particular feature of the workings of the laundry press which was not explained to and therefore not within the knowledge of the respondent. It was that the head buck could not be released at all unless it was resting on a completely flat surface. This feature was responsible for the respondent`s hand being stuck against the head buck and burnt for ten minutes.
Since the respondent did not subjectively know that the altered operation was dangerous, we considered whether a reasonable person in her position would have recognized the danger. The answer to such a question naturally depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Here, the modification was made by a technician in the appellants` employ. This was a person who was responsible for the machinery in the laundry room and it would have been reasonable for the respondent to have relied on his judgment as to the operation of the machine. This was especially so given the education level of the respondent which could be taken as fairly representative of the average education level of the laundry operators. In view of this, we thought that it would not be reasonable to have expected her to have known of the danger posed by the altered system. We were also of the view that it would be unrealistic to expect an operator in the respondent`s position to have dissented vigorously and have stopped work or have complained to the laundry manager or assistant engineer. We did not think that it was reasonable to expect an operator to make an adverse report against someone higher than her in the hierarchy of the organization, least of all when the subject matter of the report was a mechanical matter in which even the laundry manager was assisted by the technician. We found the principle set out by the House of Lords in the well-known case of 
 Smith v Baker & Sons 
, cited on behalf of the respondent, helpful with regard to this aspect of the appeal. The decision concerned whether an employer could rely on the defence of volenti non fit injuria where the employee knew of the danger involved in the work undertaken. The principle is well summarized in the headnote to the report: 
 
When an employee undertakes to do work which is intrinsically dangerous notwithstanding that reasonable care has been taken to render it as little dangerous as possible he voluntarily subjects himself to the risks inevitably accompanying it, and, if he suffers, the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria is open to his employer in defence to any claim made by him. But where a risk to the employee has been created or enhanced by the negligence of the employer in not providing a safe system of work the mere continuance by the employee in his service with knowledge of the risk does not preclude the employee, if he suffers from such negligence, from recovering in respect of the employer`s breach of duty. Whatever the dangers of the employment which the employee undertakes, among them is not to be numbered the risk of the employer`s negligence and the creation or enhancement of danger thereby engendered, unless the employee specially agrees to take that risk.
 
 
 
The latter part of the principle was relevant here and the rationale for that part was stated by Lord Herschell in the following terms (at p 88): 
 
Where, then, a risk to the employed, which may or may not result in injury, has been created or enhanced by the negligence of the employer, does the mere continuance in service, with knowledge of the risk, preclude the employed, if he suffers from such negligence, from recovering in respect of his employer`s breach of duty? I cannot assent to the proposition that the maxim volenti non fit injuria applies to such a case, and that the employer can invoke its aid to protect him from liability for his wrong. It is quite clear that the contract between employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances and to maintain them in a proper condition, and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk. Whatever the dangers of the employment which the employed undertakes, among them is certainly not to be numbered the risk of the employer`s negligence, and the creation or enhancement of danger thereby engendered. If, then, the employer thus fails in his duty towards the employed, I do not think that because he does not straightaway refuse to continue his service, it is true to say that he is willing that his employer should thus act towards him. I believe it would be contrary to fact to assert that he either invites or assents to the act or default which he complains of as a wrong, and I know of no principle of law which compels the conclusion that the maxim volenti non fit injuria becomes applicable.
 
 
 
We agreed with the rationale stated and were of the view that, although it was stated in the context of the defence of volenti non fit injuria, the rationale was of value, in most cases, to the defence of contributory negligence as well. In our view, the mere continuance in a dangerous situation created by the employer after the commencement of employment does not require of an employee an alertness out of proportion with the status of his job. It would not be fair to expect him to assume the responsibility of supervision which rightfully falls on the employer. The obligation cast upon the employee is to take such degree of care as a reasonperson in his position would take for his own safety and in determining what a reasonable person would do, a court has to look at the average level of education of an employee in that particular job and the status of that particular job. Where the status of the job imposes no duty of supervision, and the employee has neither the educational qualifications nor the training to appreciate the dangers of his work, the law does not impose upon him the obligation which counsel for the appellants argued for.
Counsel for the appellants argued that the decision in 
 Smith v Baker & Sons 
, was decided at a time when the employee was not knowledgable about machines and work procedure and that the decision in 
 Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd v Shatwell 
, indicated an acknowledgment by the same court that workers have to bear a certain amount of responsibility for their own safety. The decision in 
 Shatwell 
, was, of course, a significant development, as it recognized that the defence of volenti non fit injuria could be successfully raised, in certain circumstances, against a claim based on a breach of statutory duty when it had been thought that the defence was not applicable to such a claim. The circumstances were, however, very limited: an employer could rely on the defence where his liability was vicarious and the plaintiff employee had combined with the employee at fault to deliberately disobey the statutory rule. It ought to be observed that, in 
 Shatwell 
, the employees were of the same employment status and it was perfectly sensible that an employer should not be liable in those circumstances. Moreover the House of Lords in 
 Shatwell 
, did not disapprove of 
 Smith v Baker & Sons 
; in fact, their Lordships quoted from the judgments in the latter with approval and did not indicate that they were in any way departing from the decision in that case. Counsel for the appellants was also unable to cite any authorities criticising or departing from 
 Smith v Baker & Sons 
, and we were not convinced that the economic realities of work have changed significantly enough to undermine the basis of the principle.
Counsel for the appellants also drew our attention to the fact that about a month before the accident, the laundry manager, after discovering that someone had stuck a comb to one of the buttons on a machine in the laundry room, had warned the technicians not to alter the machines. We did not find this fact of much relevance in considering whether the respondent was contributorily negligent, simply because it did not show that the respondent knew that the technicians had been warned not to alter the machines nor did it show that she knew of the dangers of tampering with the machine. If the incident was at all of relevance, it would have been adverse to the appellants as it clearly emphasized the need for constant and proper supervision.
Counsel for the appellants also cited the cases of 
 Stavely Iron and Chemical Co Ltd v Jones 
, and 
 Williams v Port of Liverpool Stevedoring Co Ltd & Ors 
, in support of his submissions. We did not find them of much assistance. In 
 Stavely Iron and Chemical Co Ltd v Jones 
, the House of Lords doubted if the principle set out in the case of 
 Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd 
, that `... it is not for every risky thing which a workman in a factory may do in familiarity with the machinery that a plaintiff ought to be held guilty of contributory negligence ...` applied to a simple case of common law negligence as it did to a breach of statutory duty. We did not doubt that the policy reasons for applying the defence of contributory negligence narrowly in the case of a breach of statutory duty do not apply with the same force in a case of common law negligence, but we did not find that consideration of much help in this appeal since the evidence did not show that a reasonable operator in the respondent`s position would have appreciated the risk created by the altered operation. Moreover, as stated above, we did not think that it would have been reasonable to have expected a reasonable operator in the respondent`s position to have stopped working.
Counsel for the appellants relied heavily on the case of 
 Williams v Port of Liverpool Stevedoring Co Ltd 
. Reference need only be made to the headnote to the report which reads: 
 
The plaintiff was one of a gang of six men of equal status employed by the first defendants, a stevedoring company, in unloading bags of sodium carbonate from a barge. The gang were directed by the hatch foreman who was in charge of the operation and was also an employee of the stevedoring company to follow the usual and safe method of unloading, which at first they did. When the hatch foreman left to attend to other duties, however, the gang adopted a different and dangerous method of unstowing the bags. This they continued despite further direction from the foreman on his return to level off bags to avoid danger. Subsequently the foreman gave a direct order to the plaintiff to take bags off the top tiers which the plaintiff said that he would do. He did not do it. Other warnings by the master and the mate of the barge were disregarded. Eventually a pile of the bags collapsed and injured the plaintiff. In an action by the plaintiff against the stevedoring company for damages for personal injuries caused by the negligence of the company,
 
 
 
Held: (i) each member of the gang owed a duty to the other members to take reasonable care in the work of unstowing and in the method of work employed; and for the negligence of the members of the gang other than the plaintiff in adopting an unsafe method of work the stevedoring company as their employers were vicariously liable, although the plaintiff tacitly consented to the method of working and that method was contrary to orders given to him and the other members of the gang ...
 
 
(ii) the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and, as the plaintiff`s consent had been essential to the carrying out of the work by the dangerous method, his share of the responsibility was one-half and the damages recoverable would be reduced accordingly.
  
 
 
It is quite clear that the learned judge in that case found that it was the deliberate disobedience of a direct order from a superior to the plaintiff that was the basis of the holding that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. This was far removed from the facts of the present case as the evidence in this case did not show that there had been any express order conveyed to the respondent or any of the operators that the operation of the laundry press was not to be tampered with. In fact, the evidence of Baldev Singh (quoted above) showed that there had been no attempt even to draw the operators` attention to the safety features of the machines in the laundry room.
 Other matters
These considerations were sufficient to dispose of this appeal. There were, however, two other points raised by counsel for the appellants that we wish to address. First, he submitted, somewhat surprisingly in view of his concession that the appellants were to some extent liable for the injuries suffered by the respondent, that the alteration by Michael Tan was outside the scope of his employment with the consequence that the appellants could not be liable for his negligence. While the submission may have had some force in view of the warning by the laundry manager after the discovery of the comb pressed into the button of one of the machines, we were of the view that, on the facts of this case, the appellants` duty to provide and maintain a safe system of work would have made the appellants liable even if the alteration was outside of the scope of his employment. We were of the view that the learned judge was right to hold that the appellants would have been aware of the alteration had they had a proper system of supervision. The fact that there was a person who was supposed to ensure that the machines were operating safely cannot relieve the appellants as the duty to maintain a safe system of work is clearly non-delegable. Counsel in support of his argument cited the cases of 
 O`Reilly v National Rail and Tramway Appliances Lt 
 d 
, and 
 Hudson v Ridge Manufacturing Co Ltd 
, which established the proposition that an employer cannot be held vicariously liable for horseplay or isolated acts of wilful misbehaviour by one of his employees. We would agree with the general proposition but it was simply not applicable here as it was shown that the appellants knew of the previous interference but yet did not take any steps, beyond warning the technicians not to do it again, to prevent a reoccurrence. The matter would have been different if the appellants had either dismissed or disciplined the technician at fault and at the same time made it plain to the operators what the safety features of the machines were and that they were not to interfere with them.
Secondly, counsel also argued strongly that the learned judge had acquitted the appellants of any breach of statutory duty. We were unable to accept that this was so. The judgment of the learned judge made no reference to breach of statutory duty even though that had been pleaded as an alternative cause of action and this was regrettable. However, it did not equate to a finding that there had been no breach of statutory duty. In fact, on the facts before us, we were of the view that the appellants were clearly in breach of their absolute duty under s 22 of the Act (it being agreed that the laundry press was a machine within s 3 of the Act) which provides:
 
 
(1) Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than prime movers and transmission machinery shall be securely fenced unless it is in such a position or of such construction as to be safe to every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced; 
 
(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply where the dangerous part of any machinery is made safe for persons employed or working on the premises by other equally safe means.
  
 
 
While the two-handed operation of the laundry press existed, the appellants had satisfied sub-s (2) as this was as safe as fencing the machine. The removal of this safety feature clearly put the appellants in breach of their s 22 duty. That being the case, the defence of contributory negligence to this breach had even less merit. We accordingly dismissed the appeal with costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
In the early evening on 31 January 1987, the deceased was a pillion rider on a motor cycle ridden by the defendant along Old Jurong Road in the direction of Hong Kah Road when the motor cycle went off the road and collided into a tree. The deceased was killed.
Arising from this accident, the plaintiff, who is the father of the deceased, brought an action as administrator of the estate of the deceased for the benefit of the estate under s 7 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) (`the Act`) and for the benefit of the dependants of the deceased under s 11 of the Act.
 Liability
When the claim came on for hearing, the court was informed that the plaintiff would not proceed on the claim for the benefit of the dependants, and would only pursue the claim for the benefit of the estate. The court was also told that the parties had agreed on the figure of $7,000 as general damages for loss of expectation of life. Agreement had also been reached on special damages for funeral expenses of $2,500 and for costs of letters of administration of $2,200.
Apart from the defendant, there were no other witnesses to the accident. An investigating officer with the Traffic Police, who arrived at the scene at 9.10pm, reported that he found no brake marks or skid marks on the road surface. There were scratch marks on the grass verge, but he could not say how long they were. He made a sketch plan of what he saw, but the defendant had already been sent to hospital by the time he arrived at the scene, and he was unable to interview him until 17 days later.
In this case, there were no witnesses for the plaintiff, but the mere fact that the accident occurred spoke for itself and, in applying the maxim res ipsa loquitur, the court could draw an inference of negligence against the defendant so as to establish a prima facie case against him. The motor cycle was at all times under the defendant`s control and management, and the accident which involved the motor cycle going off the road and colliding into a tree could not have happened in the ordinary course of things without negligence on his part. A burden is therefore cast upon the defendant, and he must show how the accident actually occurred, and how this was consistent with due care on his part. In other words, he must rebut the inference of negligence raised against him: 
Ooi Han Sun & Anor v Bee Hua Meng
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 219
 
In his evidence, the defendant said that he was a technician in the Singapore Armed Forces with the rank of Staff Sergeant and the deceased was a clerk who worked under him. On that fateful day he had met the deceased at a mutual friend`s birthday party and was giving him a lift home when the accident occurred. Although a blood sample test showed that the deceased had a blood alcohol concentration of 79mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood (almost reaching the presumed incapability limit of 80mg under s 70 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276)), the defendant claimed that he could not remember having drunk anything at the party. According to him, he had been travelling along Corporation Road and had just turned right into Old Jurong Road. He was riding a powerful 1100cc motor cycle and, as there were no vehicles ahead of him, he had accelerated from a speed of 20 km/h to 50 km/h. When he had gone about 100m along Old Jurong Road, he saw a lorry travelling about another 100m ahead of him. The lorry was moving very slowly and, within another 100m or so, he had caught up to within three to four car lengths behind it, travelling close to the white centre line.
At that moment, a motor pickup suddenly came up to him on his left at a fast speed. It went past him `just by my left knee`, but did not touch him. The pickup then cut across him and squeezed into the space between him and the lorry. To avoid colliding with the pickup, he swerved to his right, and also applied both front and back brakes by pumping them. When he braked and swerved in this manner, he felt the deceased who was on his pillion pulling his T-shirt at the waist, and at the same time the deceased `pulled and pulled my left arm`, a movement which he demonstrated to the court. As a result, the motor cycle went off onto the grass verge on the right and collided into a tree. The pickup did not stop.
This then was the account of the accident by the defendant who was the only witness to it. It was also the basis of the claims in the defence which he filed, that the accident was caused or contributed to, first, by the negligence of the driver of the pickup; and, second, by the negligence of the deceased in `clutching and pulling violently at the defendant`s torso`. This was when he braked and swerved to avoid a collision with the pickup, and which, at the same time, foiled his attempt to keep control of his motor cycle and caused it to wobble, so that it moved to the right and collided into a tree.
At the hearing, the allegation of contributory negligence against the deceased was wisely not pressed by the defendant`s counsel. The fact was that the defen`s account of the deceased`s actions, coupled with his demonstration of the defendant`s pulling on his left arm, was totally unconvincing. Even if this had happened, it would have been a reflex or instinctive action on the part of the deceased which was brought about by the action of the defendant in braking and swerving and could not have amounted to contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.
The question which then remains is whether the accident was in fact caused by the negligence of the driver of the unknown pickup, as alleged by the defendant. In circumstances such as these, the answer must necessarily depend on whether the solitary evidence of the defendant is accepted. The account which he gave of how the pickup overtook him on his left was an unusual one, as he himself readily admitted in cross-examination. There was no conceivable reason for the pickup to have squeezed through on his left and into the restricted space between him and the lorry, when it had the whole of the right-hand side of the road to use. This would have been so if it was going to overtake both the motor cycle and the lorry; it would have been just as inconceivable if it was not going to do so.
The version which the defendant told about the pickup was broadly what he had reported to the police some 17 days after the accident when he was discharged from the hospital. I watched him carefully while he gave his evidence, and came to the conclusion that here was an otherwise honest person who, for some unknown reason, had decided while in hospital to concoct a story and, having done so, had to stick to the same silly story which did not do justice to himself and his counsel. The result was that in the witness box he could not remember simple facts which he should have remembered and was unnecessarily hesitant when he could. In my opinion, having heard his evidence and having watched him giving it, there was no pickup and there might even have been no lorry. For some reason which we do not know, the defendant simply lost control of his motor cycle and went off the road and collided into a tree. In my judgment, the defendant was wholly to blame for the accident.
 Damages
The deceased was born on 26 June 1962 and at the time of his death on 31 January 1987, he was 24 years old. He was a regular serviceman on contract service with the Singapore Armed Forces, holding the rank of corporal. His gross monthly salary was $793.97. Evidence was given on his employment and prospects by an SAF representative, Mdm Koh Ai Kim, which was accepted by both counsel. This showed that it would be reasonable to suppose that he would have been promoted to the rank of Sergeant in July 1987 and would have received his vocational upgrading to Clerk NCO Class 2 in March 1988. But because of his limited qualifications and experience, no further promotions would be likely. The contract which he was serving at the time of his death would have expired on 13 October 1989. He would probably have had a renewal of the contract, but each time the question of renewal came up, his chances of renewal would depend on his performance and on the need by the SAF for his skills. Also, non-combat clerical staff like the deceased who were originally classified as `Military Other Ranks` could be reclassified as `Non-uniform SAF staff` (NUSAF) with an appreciably lower pay-scale.
A lot of evidence was given by the plaintiff, the father of the deceased, about the deceased`s exemplary life, but all this appeared to me to be totally irrelevant. For a period of one year and four months before his death, he had in fact moved out of his father`s house which was his home, and stayed in the army camp, because he had differences with his wife who had remained behind in the house. He hardly ever went home after that, probably no more than once or twice in all; he had long ceased to pay anything to his mother, there was practically nothing in his savings account, and a few months before his death, his father had to pay for him the $400 premium on his life insurance policy.
At the conclusion of the hearing, I agreed with both counsel that they could make written submissions on quantum. The submissions, with detailed calculations, were later received from them, and have been the bases of the awards set out below.
 Pre-trial loss of earnings
In this case, the SAF representative`s evidence that the deceased would in all likelihood have been promoted to the rank of Sergeant in July 1987 was not seriously disputed, and she was also able to give evidence on the salaries which he would have received as a Sergeant up to the time of the trial. Based on this data, counsel for the plaintiff took the estimated gross salaries including the employers` CPF contributions and the increments and bonuses which would have been paid, less the income tax in each year, before arriving at a 40% available surplus of $30,964.13. Counsel for the defendant used the same data, but preferred in her calculation to work on median or average figures for the five years before trial. She omitted the bonuses on the ground that no evidence at all had been adduced on bonuses, and she contended that the available surplus should be 35% instead of the more conventional 40%, as the CPF rate in the SAF was considerably less. In the result, she arrived at a total award of $22,998.00 for the pre-trial loss. In my opinion, a court would be justified in including the known bonuses in calculating pre-trial loss, notwithstanding that no evidence was given on this during the hearing, just as income tax liability is deducted in the calculation even if no evidence is given of this. There should be no tax relief for the father, however, and in view of the considerably lower CPF rate applied in the SAF, the average surplus in this case should be 35% instead of 40%. All this would result in a rounded figure for pre-trial loss of $27,000.
 Loss of future earnings
As in the case of pre-trial loss, both counsel took as a base figure the deceased`s estimated salary at the time of the trial of $1,208.22, and employers` CPF contributions at 13.5%. The plaintiff`s counsel took into account an average of two months` bonus, together with tax relief for both parents of $2,000 before calculating the after-tax income. He also applied a multiplier of 15 from the date of the trial and an available surplus of 40% to arrive at a total claim of $109,653.84. The defendant`s counsel omitted the bonus element and the tax relief for parents. She also applied a multiplier of 15, but from the date of death, and arrived at a net multiplier of ten and an available surplus of 35%. In my opinion, it would be fair to allow for two months` bonus, but there should be no tax relief for parents, and the available surplus should be 35% for the reasons which I have given above. In the case of death claims, the relevant date for the assessment of the multiplier is the date of death: 
Cookson v Knowles
 
[1977] QB 913
[1979] AC 556
 In the present case, therefore, the net multiplier should be ten, which would leave a final figure for loss of future earnings of $63,500.
Damages to be awarded should therefore be as follows:
 General damages
 
 
(1) Loss of expectation of life $ 7,000 
 
(2) Loss of future earnings $63,500
  
 
 
 
 Special damages
 
 
 
(1) Funeral expenses $ 2,500 
 
(2) Costs of letters of administration $ 2,200 
 
(3) Pre-trial loss of earnings $27,000
  
 
 
There will be interest from the date of the writ to the date of judgment at the rate of 3% for pre-trial loss of earnings, and at 6% for loss of expectation of life, funeral expenses and the costs of letters of administration. There will also be costs payable by the defendant to the plaintiff.

The first appellant, Sim Ah Cheoh (Sim), a woman, was charged in the High Court under s 5(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act) with trafficking in a substantial quantity of drugs, namely, ten packets containing not less than 1,370.3g of diamorphine, on 26 April 1985 by transporting them from Hotel Negara at Claymore Drive to Changi Airport. The second and third appellants, Tan Chong Ngee Ronald (Tan) and Lim Joo Yin (Lim), were jointly charged under s 5(1) read with s 12 of the Act with abetting Sim in committing that offence. All three of them were tried jointly and were each found guilty of the charges and were convicted. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought, and at the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution which is not in dispute is this. Sometime in February 1985, Tan enquired of one of his friends, Loo Lian Seng, whether the latter knew anyone who might be willing to engage in smuggling `precious stones`. In the following month, Loo furnished Tan with the name and telephone number of Sim and informed Tan that Sim might be interested. Sim at that time was heavily in debt due to excessive gambling and had indicated that she was so interested. As a result of the information given by Loo, Tan got in touch with Sim. Thereafter, Tan and Lim made all necessary arrangements for Sim to travel from Singapore to the United States of America: Tan assisted her in obtaining a visa to travel to the United States and Lim made a booking for her for the `West Coast Panorama` tour of the United States organized by Sino-America Travel Corporation Pte Ltd (SATCO) and paid for the cost of the tour. The tour was scheduled to depart from Singapore on 26 April 1985 at 3pm on Singapore Airlines flight SQ 2.
On 25 April 1985, Tan reserved a single room at Hotel Negara in his name. He checked into the hotel that evening and early in the following morning he left in a taxi for Pearl Bank Apartment. Sim lived in one of the flats in Pearl Bank Apartment. There was no evidence that Tan met Sim there that morning; but there was evidence that soon after his arrival at that block of apartments he took a Chinese woman in a taxi from there to Hotel Negara. There was evidence that on that morning Sim and Tan had breakfast at the Chinta Manis Coffee House in Hotel Negara. There was also evidence that soon after 10am, the same morning, a waiter, Ng Cheng Bye, served a plate of pork chop to Tan in his room. At about 12 noon, Tan checked out of the hotel. Again there was no evidence that Sim left the hotel with Tan. There was evidence, however, that Tan and a Chinese woman at the hotel took a taxi to the airport, and on arrival at the airport the Chinese woman alighted at the departure hall, while Tan remained in the taxi and returned to the city.
At the airport departure hall, at about 12 noon on 26 April 1985, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau led by Chief Narcotics Officer Teo Ho Peng (`CNO Teo`) were keeping a lookout for Sim. On the previous day, CNO Teo acting on information had been to SATCO and spoken to one Joanne Lam Yoke Chan, an employee of SATCO, who was to lead the `West Coast Panorama` tour to the United States. He enquired about Sim and was informed that Sim was one of the 12 persons joining the tour and he was given a copy of the list of passengers. He instructed Joanne Lam to identify Sim and her luggage to him at the airport on the following day. Joanne Lam, on 26 April 1985, arrived at the airport at about 12.45pm. She had with her her passengers` flight tickets and passports, including those of Sim. At the airport, Joanne Lam met CNO Teo again and also a woman assistant narcotics officer Wong See Joon (`WNO Wong`) and was reminded by CNO Teo of the arrangement. Joanne Lam was also instructed to check in Sim`s luggage but ensure that it was not placed on a conveyor belt as the luggage would be searched.
Passengers for flight SQ 2 were to check in at counter 3 in the departure hall, and accordingly Joanne Lam proceeded to counter 3 with WNO Wong. In the vicinity of that counter, she saw Sim with her luggage and she approached Sim who identified herself as Sim. Joanne Lam then nodded to CNO Teo thus indicating that the person she spoke to was Sim. Joanne Lam then took Sim`s luggage and checked in the same as instructed.
Among the narcotics officers who were at the departure hall was Senior Narcotics Officer Lim Chei Yoo (SNO Lim); he was the investigating officer with direct responsibility in the case, reporting, however, to CNO Teo. He took up his position close to counter 3 and saw CNO Teo and WNO Wong speaking to Joanne Lam. Subsequently, he saw CNO Teo signalling to him thus indicating Sim to him. Later, he saw Joanne Lam approaching Sim and handing her passport and boarding pass to her, following which Sim walked to the departure gate and passed through the immigration counter. SNO Lim and other narcotics officers trailed her. Sim proceeded to departure gate C32 and entered the screening room. In the screening room, SNO Lim approached her, identified himself and took possession of her passport. Other narcotics officers came and Sim was brought outside the screening room. There, another woman assistant narcotics officer, Lim Peck Yan, was present. SNO Lim instructed WNO Lim Peck Yan to act as an interpreter in Mandarin and told Sim that he was a narcotics officer. He asked Sim through WNO Lim Peck Yan whether she had any drugs in her possession, to which Sim replied, pointing to her chest, in Mandarin: `Yes, few packets inside.` Later, Sim told SNO Lim that she did not know what the packets contained.
CNO Teo arrived at the departure gate soon afterwards and gave instructions for Sim to be searched. She was escorted to the search room and was searched by the two woman assistant narcotics officers, Wong See Joon and Lim Peck Yan, and was found to have cloth bags strapped or otherwise attached to her person. She was wearing an abdominal binder, a panty girdle and a thigh guard on each thigh. Two long cloth bags and three smaller bags were held in place under the abdominal binder. Under the panty girdle were two long cloth bags, one against each hip. A third bag was held by the girdle against Sim`s abdomen. There was a long cloth bag under each thigh guard. Each of these bags, wrapped in masking tape, held a plastic packet containing white powder. In total there were ten packets.
Later, Sim was taken to the Central Narcotics Bu. At the Bureau, Sim told SNO Lim that when she reached the United States she was to hand the drugs she was carrying to a person who would hand her a HK$100 note, the last digit of the serial number of which would be in a sequence to that of a HK$10 note in her possession. She handed the HK$10 note to SNO Lim.
Later in the afternoon, arrangements were made for a statement to be recorded from her under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). The recording officer was Senior Narcotics Officer S Vijakumar and the interpreter was Wu Nan Yong. The woman assistant narcotics officer, Wong See Joon, was also present. A statement was recorded from her, to which we shall revert in a moment.
Meanwhile, instructions had been given to narcoofficers to arrest Tan and Lim. They were arrested the same evening and brought to the Central Narcotics Bureau. When they were brought to SNO Lim`s office at about 8.45pm, Sim was there, and on seeing Tan and Lim, she identified them to SNO Lim as being the persons who had assisted her. Sim was then escorted out to another room. Tan and Lim were searched and among the items found in Lim`s person were (i) a slip of paper bearing the full name and identity card number of Sim and (ii) another slip of paper with Sim`s full name on it, some figures and the legend `S & USA` and two copies of a document containing flight details and an itinerary issued by SATCO. It was subsequently ascertained that the slip of paper described in (i) was written by Tan to Lim.
On the following day, arrangements were made for statements to be recorded from Tan and Lim under s 122(6) of the CPC. The recording officer was also SNO Vijakumar and the interpreter was Wu Nan Yong. Statements were recorded from both of them respectively to which we shall refer in a moment.
The contents of the ten packets found on Sim`s person were analysed and were found to contain not less than 1,370.3g of diamorphine.
At the trial, the admissibility of the statements made by the appellants respectively was objected to by their respective counsel on the ground that they were in each case not made voluntarily. A trial within a trial was held, and the trial judges at the conclusion found that each of the statements was made voluntarily. They were therefore admitted in evidence. The material part of the statement of Sim was as follows: 
 
I was made use by a male Chinese whose name I don`t know. About a month ago he told me to smuggle diamonds and I agreed. About two weeks ago he told me to smuggle `peh hoon` and the amount will only be one packet. I agreed as I thought the quantity is small. He also told me that even if I were to be arrested in US I would be jailed for a few years only. This morning at about 5am he fetched me from my home to a hotel in Orchard Road. Inside the hotel room another male Chinese took out and showed me ten packets of `peh hoon` which were already packed. The first male Chinese asked me to strap them to my body. I told him I could not carry the ten packets of `peh hoon` because it would be difficult to strap all to my body. He then told me that he has already promised someone in US to deliver ten packets of `peh hoon`. Then I strapped the ten packets to my body. After strapping he gave me a piece of Hong Kong dollar note stating that the person who`s to take delivery of the ten packets of `peh hoon` will produce another Hong Kong dollar note, the last digit of the serial number being consecutive to that of mine.
 
 
 
The statement of Tan was as follows: 
 
On 26 April 1985 at 6.45am, `Ah Hai` rang me up and told me to call `Sum Ku Leong`. I then rang her and told her to come down to the ground floor of her Pearl Bank apartment. She came down and I brought her to Negara Hotel Room No 202. Here I received Ah Hai`s telephone call and told him `Sum Ku Leong` was with me. After a short while Ah Hai came into the room holding a black plastic bag in his hand. Ah Hai then took out some packets from the bag and I helped him to strap the packets onto Sum Ku Leong`s body. After the strapping `Sum Ku Leong` put on her suit and blouse and walked around to see whether the packets would drop or not. Then `Ah Hai` told her to remove the strapping and re-strap the packets so that she would be able to remove it herself. `Sum Ku Leong` did as told and when `Ah Hai` was satisfied he left the room. Sum Ku Leong and myself then boarded a taxi to go to Changi Airport. At the airport she alighted while I left in the same taxi for home.
 
 
 
After the statement was taken, the recording officer, SNO Vijakumar, asked Tan certain questions which Tan answered, and the questions and answers were as follows:
 
 
Q1: In line 1 you mentioned `Ah Hai`. Who is Ah Hai? 
 
A: Ah Hai was the male Chinese who was arrested with me on 26 April 1985. I do not know his real name. 
 
Q2: In line 2 you mentioned `Sum Ku Leong`. Who is Sum Ku Leong? 
 
A: She was the woman arrested before I was arrested. I also do not know her real name. 
 
Q3: In line 9 you said Ah Hai took out some packets from the plastic bag. What do you think was inside the packets? 
 
A: I do not know but from the softness of the packets, I guessed it was `peh hoon`.
  
 
 
The statement recorded from Lim was as follows: 
 
A male Chinese known to me only as `Lau Tah` asked me once to get a person to deliver something. I then went to look for Ronald about getting someone for delivering something. Later Ronald told me he had found a female Chinese who is willing to deliver. When `Lau Tah` rang me I told him I have a person who is willing to deliver. `Lau Tah` then gave me money to buy clothing and air ticket to USA for the female Chinese whom Ronald and I called `Ah Che`. At about 8am on 26 April 1985 `Lau Tah` handed me a plastic bag outside Negara Hotel and he left. I took this bag and went to a room in Hotel Negara where Ronald and `Ah Che` were waiting for me. I then took out the packets from the plastic bag which `Lau Tah` had given me earlier on and asked `Ah Che` to strap them to her body. When I took the packets out I felt something soft inside them. All the packets were prepared and ready for strapping. Ronald and I helped `Ah Che` to strap the packets. After this I left them.
 
 
 
The recording officer also asked Lim certain questions which Lim answered, and they were as follows:
 
 
Q1: Who is `Lau Tah` as mentioned by you in line 2. 
 
A: `Lau Tah` is in his 40`s but I don`t know his real name. I think he`s a Singaporean. 
 
Q2: How long do you know `Lau Tah`? 
 
A: I know `Lau Tah` for about four months. 
 
Q3: How did you come to know `Lau Tah`? 
 
A: A Malaysian friend of mine `Ah Tee` introduced me to `Lau Tah` at a coffee-shop. 
 
Q4: In lines 2 and 3 you said `Lau Tah` asked you to get someone to deliver something. What`s the `something`? 
 
A: At first I did not bother about the `something`. Later on I guessed it would be something illegal. 
 
Q5: Who is Ronald as mentioned in line 3 by you? 
 
A: Ronald is my friend who was arrested on the same day as myself, that is on 26 April 1985. 
 
Q6: You said in lines 17 and 18 that when you took the packets out from the plastic bag, you felt something soft inside them. Did you know what was inside? 
 
A: I guessed it was `peh hoon`.
  
 
 
At the close of the case for the prosecution, counsel for the appellants respectively submitted that no case had been made out against the appellants, which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions on the charges against them. These arguments were rejected by the trial judges who held that a case had been made out and called upon the appellants to enter upon their defence. Each of the appellants elected not to give evidence or to call any evidence in their defence. The trial judges held that in the circumstances they `had no alternative but to convict all three accused as charged`.
Before us, counsel for the appellants mounted three main arguments in support of the appeal. First, it was argued by counsel for Sim, who advanced this argument on behalf of all the appellants, that the prosecution had failed to prove an essential ingredient of the charge against Sim, namely, that Sim transported the drugs from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport (as described in the charge); that there was no evidence at all of such transportation, save for the statements recorded from the appellants, and that the finding of the trial judges that the ingredient of transportation had been established was based on an inference they drew and on the statements. It was not safe, so counsel submitted, to draw such inference of transportation, because there were competing rational inferences, and as for the statements they could not be relied upon as a foundation of the conviction of Sim. There was therefore a fatal gap or break in the evidence against Sim, and the charge against her had not been proved. In consequence, the charge against Tan and Lim for abetting Sim in trafficking in drugs could not stand.
There are two limbs in this argument. The first was directed to the proper inference that could be drawn from the evidence adduced as there was no direct evidence that Sim transported the drugs from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport. The direct relevant evidence which was not challenged or disputed established the following: that Tan had recruited Sim to smuggle `precious stones`; that both Tan and Lim made all the necessary travelling arrangements for Sim to travel from Singapore to the United States; that early in the morning of 26 April 1985, Tan, who had on the previous night checked into Hotel Negara, went to Pearl Bank Apartment where Sim stayed, and from there he brought a Chinese woman to Hotel Negara; that in that morning a waitress at the coffee house in Hotel Negara served breakfast to Tan and Sim; that at about 10am a waiter served a plate of pork chop to Tan in his room; that at about 12 noon Tan checked out of the hotel and took a Chinese woman in a taxi to the airport where the woman alighted; that at the departure hall of Changi Airport Sim was identified by Joanne Lam to CNO Teo who then identified her to SNO Lim; that thenceforth Sim was under surveillance and was trailed to the departure gate C32 and the screening room where she was arrested, and that upon arrest she was found to have strapped to her person the ten packets, each containing white powder, which upon analysis were found to contain no less than 1,370.3g of diamorphine. From these primary facts the only proper inference that one can draw is that Sim was the woman who was brought from Pearl Bank Apartment to Hotel Negara, that she was also the woman who travelled with Tan in a taxi from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport and that she had with her during this journey the ten packets of white substance which were subsequently found strapped to her person. Counsel did not show us what other competing inference could sensibly and reasonably be drawn from these facts; when asked, his riposte was that it was for the prosecution to fill this gap in the evidence. In our opinion, these primary facts do not admit of any other inference; any other inference would, in the words of the trial judges, be wholly fanciful.
The second limb of the argument was directed to the three statements made by the appellants respectively under s 122(6) of the CPC. It was argued that the only evidence which proved the essential ingredient of the charge against Sim, ie the transportation of the drugs from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport, consisted of the three statements and that each of these statements was a confession made by a co-accused which affected himself or herself (as the case may be) and the other accused and could not be relied on solely as a basis or foundation for sustaining the conviction of Sim and consequently the convictions of Tan and Lim. Where the other evidence adduced was insufficient to establish the charge or was wholly unsatisfactory there was no scope for a conviction of an accused on the sole basis of the confession of a co-accused. The basis of counsel`s submission is s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) which provides as follows: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court 
 may take into consideration
 such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
This section is in pari materia with s 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, and it has been decided in a series of Indian cases that under that section a confession of an accused implicating himself and his co-accused may be taken into consideration along with other evidence and a conviction based only on such confession cannot stand. These cases have thus given a narrow construction to the words `may take into consideration` in that section. Counsel referred us to numerous cases, among which were: 
 Bhuboni Sahu 
 
 v 
 
 The King 
 1949 AIR 36 PC 257 and 
 Kashmira Singh 
 
 v 
 
 State of Madhya Pradesh 
 [1952] SC 526. In 
 Bhuboni Sahu, 
 which was an appeal to the Privy Council, the evidence consisted of mainly the confession of a co-accused which implicated the co-accused and the appellant and the Privy Council held, among other things, that this confession was not sufficient to sustain the conviction of the appellant of murder and the conviction was set aside. Sir John Beaumont in delivering the judgment of the Board said, at p 260: 
 
Section 30 seems to be based on the view that an admission by an accused person of his own guilt affords some sort of sanction in support of the truth of his confession against others as well as himself. But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed come within the definition of `evidence` contained in s 8, Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of those infirmities. Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence. The Lordships think that the view which has prevailed in most of the High Courts in India, namely, that the confession of a co-accused can be used only in support of other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of a conviction, is correct.
 
 
 
In 
 Kashmira Singh, 
 the Supreme Court of India held that the evidence for the conviction of the accused of murder, which was based substantially on the evidence of a confession of a co-accused implicating himself and the accused, was insufficient and set aside the conviction of murder. Vivian Bose J said, at pp 529-530: 
 
In our opinion, the matter was put succinctly by Sir Lawrence Jenkins in 
 Emperor
 
 v
 
 Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty
 [1911] ILR 38 Cal 559 at 588 where he said that such a confession can only be used to `lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused` or, to put it in another way, as Reilly J did in 
 Re Periyaswami Moopan
 [1931] ILR 54 Mad 75 at 77:
 
 
 
`the provision goes no further than this - where there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of confession described in s 30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for believing that evidence.`
 
 
 
Translating these observations into concrete terms they come to this. The proper way to approach a case of this kind is, first, to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether, 
 if it is believed,
 a conviction could safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the confession in aid. But cases may arise where the judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, 
 if believed,
 it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction. In such an event the judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be prepared to accept.
 
 
 
Similarly, the courts in Malaysia have also adopted the same construction of the words `may take into consideration` in the corresponding provision, namely, s 30 of the Malaysian Evidence Act 1950. In 
 Yusoff & Anor 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 47
  at pp 48-49 Mathew CJ said: 
 
... even accepting the confession of the second appellant as being both voluntary and true, there is the question whether the confession was sufficient to establish the guilt of the first appellant. Section 30 of the Evidence Ordinance reads:
 
 
 
`When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court 
 may take into consideration
 such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.` (The emphasis is ours.)
 
 
 
The effect of the words `may take into consideration` is well set out in 
 Woodroffe and Ameer Ali`s Law of Evidence
 (9th Ed) at pp 312 and 313, as follows:
 
 
 
`These words do not mean that the confession is to have the force of sworn evidence, but such a confession is nevertheless evidence in the sense that it is matter which the court, before whom it is made, may take into consideration in order to determine whether the issue of guilt is proved or not. The wording, however, of this section (which is an exception) shows that such a confession is merely to be an element in the consideration of all the facts of the case; while allowing it to be so considered, it does not do away with the necessity of other evidence.`
 
 
 
The other evidence is of little, if of any, value and merely shows that the two appellants were seen together about midnight on 19/20 September 1955. In fact, the convictions rest entirely on the confession of the second appellant which we have already pointed out is wrong.
 
 
 
Similar pronouncement was made by the Federal Court of Malaysia in 
 PP 
 
 v 
 
 Nordin bin Johan & Anor 
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 221
  at p 222.
These cases are undoubted authorities on the construction and application of s 30 of the Evidence Act and we respectfully agree with the views expressed in these decisions. However, on the evidence before us, this argument on behalf of the appellants must fail. We revert again, very briefly, to the statements made by the appellants respectively. Sim`s statement was evidence against herself as to possession of the heroin and of the preparatory steps taken to carry them to the United States. Tan`s statement was evidence against (i) Sim as to possession and transportation of the heroin by Sim from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport and (ii) himself as to abetting Sim in strapping the heroin to her person and in transporting them. Lim`s statement was evidence against himself as to possession of the heroin and abetting Sim in strapping the heroin to her person with a view to transporting them. These statements were not the only evidence against Sim as to transportation of the heroin. There was a preponderance of other evidence against Sim on that point. As we have demonstrated, there were primary facts which had been established by direct evidence and which, in our view, led inescapably to the inference that she carried the heroin from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport. Accordingly, in our judgment, these statements were not the foundation of the conviction of Sim of the offence with which she was charged. They `lent assurance to the other evidence`. In so far as the convictions of Tan and Lim are concerned their statements as against them respectively were evidence of the parts they played respectively in assisting Sim in the transportation of the heroin and can be relied upon. Again, there was also other evidence that they assisted Sim. We accordingly rejected the first argument submitted on behalf of the appellants.
The second argument mounted by counsel for Sim, who again advanced this argument on behalf of all the appellants, was that there was a miscarriage of justice in that the trial judges failed to consider whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. After the appellants were called upon by the trial judges to enter upon their defence, they elected not to give evidence or to call any evidence in their defence. The trial judges in their grounds of decision said: 
 
Accordingly, we found that a case against all three accused had been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant their conviction. They were called upon to make their defence, and were given the standard allocution. Counsel then asked for an adjournment, which was granted. Upon resumption of the trial counsel for Sim, speaking for himself and for counsel representing Tan and Lim, informed us that each accused had decided not to give evidence, and not to call other evidence, all the accused standing on the submissions of their respective counsel that the prosecution had failed to prove transportation beyond reasonable doubt.
 
 
 
In the result, we had no alternative but to convict all those accused as charged. We did so, and sentenced them to death.
The criticism made by counsel on the last paragraph of the grounds of decision was that the trial judges at that juncture did not proceed to examine and assess the evidence adduced and consider whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt; the test which the trial judges applied in deciding to call upon the appellants to enter on their defence is not the same as that in deliberating on the guilt of the appellants at the end of the trial. In support, counsel relied on the following passage of the judgment of Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  at p 52: 
 
At the conclusion of the prosecution`s case what has to be decided remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding `that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction`, within the meaning of s 188(1). Where he has not so found, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and as decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution`s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides have addressed to the judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as they may wish to advance.
 
 
 
Technically and in so far as the last paragraph of the grounds of decision of the trial judges is concerned, the point made by counsel is valid. In a criminal trial there are two critical stages at which the court has to make a decision. Under s 189(1) of the CPC, at the close of the case for the prosecution, the court has to decide whether the prosecution has made out a case, which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction of the accused. In deciding this question or issue, the court ought not to consider whether the possession has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 said, at p 51: 
 
The crucial words in s [189(1)] are the words `if unrebutted`, which make the question that the court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such evidence that the words `if unrebutted` refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s [189(1)] the court must act on the presumptions (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.
 
 
 
At that stage, what the court has to decide is whether the evidence adduced, which is not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If the court so decides that each essential element in the alleged offence has been established he must call for the defence. At that stage, however, he must keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of the evidence. After the defence has been called and evidence, if any, of the accused and other witnesses has been tendered and counsel for both sides have made their respective closing submissions, the court must, at that stage, proceed to examine the evidence adduced, assess the veraand accuracy thereof and consider whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
In the instant case, the trial judges did not spell out in the last paragraph of their grounds of decision that at the second or final stage of the trial they had considered all the evidence and found that the guilt of the appellants had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, at the trial in making their findings on the guilt of the appellants they said: 
 
Please tell the first accused that we find her guilty as charged and we accordingly convict her of the offence with which she has been charged. Similarly, please tell the second accused Ronald Tan Cheng Ngee that we are again satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty as charged and we convict him accordingly. And thirdly, please tell the accused Lim Joo Yin that we are also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty as charged and we convict him accordingly.
 
 
 
Therefore, having regard to these findings and the evidence before them, the trial judges must have found that on the evidence the prosecution had proved its case against the appellants beyond any reasonable doubt, though they did not explicitly say so in the concluding part of their grounds of decision. That they had reached the conclusion that a case beyond any reasonable doubt had been established by the prosecution was also evident from the following passage of their grounds of decision: 
 
In our judgment, the objective facts established by the evidence allowed of only one sensible inference. The statements of all three accused established that the packets containing the drugs were strapped to Sim`s person in a room at Hotel Negara. Tan and Lim assisted in the strapping operation. Tan`s statement made it clear that after the packets had been strapped on for the first time, Sim dressed and walked about the room to ensure that the packets were secure. Lim then instructed her to remove the packets, and restrap them onto herself so that she would be able to unstrap them on her own. Sim did as she was told, and only when Lim was satisfied did he leave the room. Tan`s statement went on to say that he and Sim `then boarded a taxi to go to Changi Airport`. At the airport, Sim disembarked and Tan proceeded back to his house in the same taxi.
 
 
 
To suggest, in the face of that evidence, that the packets having been strapped onto Sim for the second time to Lim`s satisfaction in Hotel Negara, they were then removed, were not transported by Sim in the taxi, but re-materialized at the airport for her to have strapped them on there, was in our view wholly fanciful.
Having reached that conclusion and in view of the fact that the defence had not tendered any evidence by the appellants or any other witness the trial judges probably considered that it would be tautologous to repeat the same exercise. It seems to us that for that reason they said they had no alternative but to convict the appellants.
Assuming that there was an error made by the trial judges, as contended on behalf of the appellants, in our judgment, no miscarriage of justice at all has occurred in this case. The evidence against Sim was overwhelming, and so also was the evidence against Tan and Lim. Apart from the admissibility of the three statements of the appellants, there was substantially no dispute on the evidence adduced by the prosecution in any material respect. As for those statements, their admissibility was challenged but the trial judges, after the trial within a trial, were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were made voluntarily, and, accordingly, they were admitted in evidence. In our judgment, on such evidence, the trial judges could not have reached any other conclusion than that the guilt of the appellants had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Plainly, this is a case where the proviso to s 54 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) is applicable.
Finally, counsel for the appellants sought to impeach the findings of the trial judges that the statements recorded from the appellants respectively under s 122(6) of the CPC were given by them voluntarily. These are purely findings of fact. The trial judges had considered the evidence given by the appellants and also the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses. They rejected the evidence of the appellants and accepted the evidence of SNO Lim, SNO Vijakumar and Wu Nan Yong, and found that the statements were made by the appellants voluntarily. The trial judges, on the evidence before them, were justified in coming to such findings. There is, however, one argument advanced by counsel for Tan and Lim which merits consideration.
In recording the statements from Tan and Lim respectively, SNO Vijakumar asked them several questions on the statements and the answers were given by them respectively. It was argued by counsel that SNO Vijakumar cross-examined them on the statements recorded, and such cross-examinations were improper and rendered the statements inadmissible. The trial judges considered the evidence and the explanation given by SNO Vijakumar for asking the questions, and held that the questions were not put to them by way of cross-examination. We are unable to agree with the views of the trial judges on this point. In our opinion, the questions asked were more than those truly required for clarification. They were asked with a view to eliciting answers from the maker of the statement which would be evidence favourable to the party questioning. SNO Vijakumar need not have asked, and ought not to have asked, those questions. The purpose of s 122(6) of the CPC is to inform the accused of the charge he is facing and to give him an opportunity of stating any fact on which he intends to rely in his defence in court and further to warn him that if he does not state it then, his silence may give rise to an adverse inference against him. The role of a recording officer is spelt out in s 122(6): to prefer and read out the charge to the accused or to inform him officially of the charge, to serve on him a notice in writing in terms as prescribed in that subsection, to explain the notice to him, and thereafter if the accused wishes to say anything, to record accurately what he says. It is no part of the duty of such recording officer to ask the accused any question in relation to what he said. In our opinion, any cross-examination conducted by a recording officer on the statement taken from the accused under s 122(6) is improper, and we disapprove it. Any other form of questioning, unless it is absolutely necessary, is wholly inadvisable and is to be discouraged.
The next question is whether by reason of such cross-examination the statements made by Tan and Lim are admissible. The trial judges appeared to take the view that where an accused person makes a statement under s 122(6) of the CPC, questions asked by the recording officer by way of cross-examination are improper and render the resultant statement inadmissible and accepted the case of 
 Cheng Seng Heng & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 175
  as the authority. That was a case decided by the Court of Appeal of the Federation of Malaya on the basis of reg 33 of the Emergency Regulations 1948, and Spenser-Wilkinson J in delivering the judgment of the court, after referring to some English and local authorities, said, at p 178: 
 
On the principles enunciated in the above-quoted authorities we hold that under reg 33 of the Emergency Regulations the police have no right to elicit statements from accused persons by means of cross-examination or anything in the nature of cross-examination. The only safe rule to be followed when statements are being taken from accused persons by the police under reg 33 is r 7 of the Judges` Rules set out above and any departure from this rule will render the statements inadmissible in evidence.
 
 
 
The Judges` Rules referred to in the judgment are the Judges` Rules then in force in England, and r 7 thereof was identical with r 8 of Sch E to proviso (b) of sub-s (5) of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code then in force. But sub-s (5) (which was the precursor of the existing sub-s (6) of s 122) and Sch E were introduced to the Criminal Procedure Code by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1960. Section 121 (now s 122) by sub-s (5) thereof for the first time allowed a statement made at any time by a person who is charged with an offence in the hearing of a police officer of or above the rank of inspector to be admissible in evidence at his trial, but such admission was expressly made subject to two provisos, namely: (i) proviso (a) which was in pari materia with the proviso to the existing s 122(5), and (ii) proviso (b) which is as follows: 
 
in the case of a statement made by such person after his arrest if it appears to the court that the statement was not made and recorded substantially in compliance with the provisions of the rules set out in Schedule E to this Code.
 
 
 
And r 8 of the Rules as set out in Sch E to the Code provided: 
 
A prisoner making a voluntary statement must not be cross-examined, and no questions shall be put to him about it except for the purpose of removing ambiguity in what he has actually said. For instance, if he has mentioned an hour without saying whether it was morning or evening, or has given a day of the week and day of the month which do not agree, or has not made it clear to what individual or what place is intended to refer in some part of his statement, he may be questioned sufficiently to clear up the point.
 
 
 
By the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1976 (which came into force on 1 January 1977), among other things, the proviso (b) to the then s 121(5) and Sch E were repealed, and the present sub-s (6) of s 122 was introduced. Hence, with the repeal of those provisions, there is nothing in s 122 to say that a statement recorded from an accused under s 122(6) is inadmissible in evidence if in the course of or after recording the statement the accused is cross-examined thereon by the recording officer. In our opinion, cross-examination per se does not render the statement inadmissible, if it is otherwise admissible. The admissibility of a statement recorded under s 122(6) is not governed by that subsection but, in the case where a statement is made to a police officer, is governed by s 122(5) of the CPC: see 
 Tsang Yuk Chung 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 264
 , and in the case of a statement made to a narcotics officer, as in this case, by the Evidence Act: see 
 PP 
 
 v 
 
 Tan Boon Tat 
 
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
 
 . 
 In 
 Tsang Yuk Chung 
, Wee Chong Jin CJ, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said, at p 266: 
 
Section 122(6) itself does not provide for the admissibility of statements recorded thereunder. The admissibility of such statements must still be founded upon s 122(5) as one of the exceptions to s 122(1) which, prima facie, prohibits the use in evidence of any statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation.
 
 
 
That s 122(5) governs the admissibility of statements made under s 122(6) is confirmed by s 122(7), which reads: 
 
`No statement made by an accused person in answer to a written notice served on him pursuant to sub-s (6) shall be construed as a statement caused by any inducement, threat or promise as is described in the proviso to sub-s (5), if it is otherwise voluntary.`
 
 
 
In our judgment, a statement whether or not it is purported to have been made under s 122(6) is admissible in evidence so long as s 122(5) is satisfied. There is no doubt that an inculpatory statement so admitted is evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
 
 
However, cross-examination could in certain circumstances render the statement or the answers to the questions inadmissible, eg if the questioning is so vigorous or prolonged that it becomes oppressive with the result that a doubt arises as to whether the statement or the answers have been caused by any fear or threat. Such, however, was not the case.
In the result, all the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants failed and the appeal was accordingly dismissed.

On 2 December 1991 at about 10.45am, the vessel Hudson Bay was anchored at the Eastern Special Purposes Anchorage and receiving fuel oil from a bunker barge into its tank No 15. The fast pumping rate caused a sudden overflow of oil from the air vent of the tank onto the deck, and over the side of the Hudson Bay into the sea. The resulting oil slick measured about 300m by 5m in broken patches, covering an area of some 1,500m2. Cleaning operations were carried out by the anti-pollution sea unit of the Port of Singapore Authority. The costs of these operations amounted to $12,859 and were paid in full by the appellants, the agents of Hudson Bay.
The appellants were charged in the subordinate courts with an offence under s 7 of the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act (Cap 243) (`the Act`). So far as is material, s 7(1) provides: 
 
... if any discharge of oil or an oily mixture occurs from a Singapore ship into any part of the sea or from any ship into Singapore waters, the master, the owner and the agent of the ship shall each be guilty of an offence and shall each be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.
 
 
 
The appellants pleaded guilty to the offence. In mitigation it was said that pollution had been caused accidentally, and that as soon as the spill had been discovered the pumping had been stopped and detergent immediately sprayed. The appellants had no antecedents.
The learned district judge imposed a fine of $10,000, which the appellants appealed against as being manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal.
Before me, the thrust of the submissions of counsel for the appellants was that a fine of $10,000 was manifestly excessive, being significantly higher than the usual range of fines for this offence. He pointed out that in PSA Summons No 737 of 1989 which involved a slick covering some 300m2 and cleaning-up costs of $11,456, the accused was only fined $4,000 despite seven similar previous convictions. The learned DPP also provided statistics on the various fines imposed in 1990 and 1991 for convictions for this offence, which ranged from the bare minimum of $500 to $5,000. The highest fine for this offence which counsel were acquainted with was a fine of $10,000 imposed by the district court in another case, which was subsequently reduced to $7,500 on appeal to the High Court.
Counsel for the appellants contended that this case could not be distinguished from the others, either on the ground of moral culpability or on the ground that the consequences of the spillage were more serious, such as would justify the imposition of a fine significantly higher than those within the usual range. Further, the appellants had pleaded guilty, and according to the usual principles of sentencing, as enunciated for example by Cumming-Bruce LJ in 
 R v Boyd 
 ,1 this should have proved a mitigating factor as regards the severity of the fine imposed.
The learned DPP, however, contended that notwithstanding the statistics a fine of $10,000 could not be excessive, having regard to the obvious legislative intention of keeping the sea free of oil pollution. I agreed with him and dismissed the appeal.
The range of fines permitted by the Act is very wide, ranging from $500 to $500,000, and it would in my opinion be useful to make some comments on the sentencing guidelines to be applied in such cases.
It was common ground between the parties that the offence under s 7 was one of strict liability, in their case merely requiring proof of a discharge of oil from a ship into Singapore waters. It was not necessary to prove fault on the part of the master, owner or agent of the ship to render any of them liable. In the present case, the appellants contended that the spillage had been caused through no fault of theirs or of the master or crew of the Hudson Bay. They said that the unlawful discharge had occurred because the bunker barge supplying the fuel oil had done so at a faster rate than that requested by the Hudson Bay crew, which the ship`s tanks were unable to handle.
The presence or absence of fault on the part of the defendant is generally a relevant consideration when it comes to sentencing. Similarly, that a defendant is a first-time offender and that he has pleaded guilty to the offence would normally also constitute mitigating factors in this context. However, the principles which apply to sentencing for an offence of strict liability are different. The usual objectives of sentencing and the penal system as a whole, of individual deterrence, general deterrence and reformation, as enunciated by Keith Devlin in his book 
 On Sentencing Offenders In Magistrates` Courts 
 (1970 Ed), can have little bearing in the case of an offence which may be committed without fault on the part of the offender, or even against his active wishes. The nature of strict liability offences is such that they may be committed even when all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that they are not committed. Therefore, no fine which could be imposed would necessarily prove a deterrent to the commission of such an offence.
Thus the only objective for the most part that there could reasonably be behind sentencing for a strict liability offence is that the sentence be, in the words of Keith Devlin, retributive: that the sentence imposed should be measured by the disapproval of society regarding the nature of the offence committed. A high sentence, therefore, would reflect the gravity of the offence. The maximum penalties should be reserved for the most serious cases in terms of consequences as well as conduct. The presence of fault and of previous convictions can only be relevant in this context.
It is beyond question that environmental concerns have become an important issue on both the national and global platforms. Only now are we beginning to realize the true extent of the long-term damage that may be caused to our immediate environment by oil pollution, to our sea resources and marine life. Also, as was pointed out by the learned DPP, Singapore has enacted the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil in the Act, and is a signatory to the 1982 Convention for the Law of the Sea. Further, Singaporean Ambassador Professor Tommy Koh chaired the recent UN Conference on Environment and Development. It is evident from this that Singapore has undertaken obligations under international law to ensure that her seas and environment be kept clean and free of pollution. In the light of growing awareness of the damaging effects of oil pollution on a national as well as a global scale, and in order to combat this, it is imperative that the courts regard offences of pollution with the utmost gravity. Parliament has evinced its concern for the seriousness of these offences by making them ones of strict liability. As far as sentencing for these offences go, I am of the view that the fines previously imposed for offences under s 7(1) taken in today`s context do not accurately reflect the strong public interest in preventing oil pollution as discussed above. I am certain that similar considerations were in the mind of the district judge in this case at the hearing below, when he imposed the fine that was outside the range previously imposed.
In this case, the appellants were carrying out an activity which was potentially hazardous: they must have been aware of the pollution that would result had something gone wrong in the process. That they would be liable to a high fine even if the pollution had not been caused through their culpability, in the words of Lord Salmon in 
 Alphacell Ltd v Woodward 
 2 at p 848, `may be regarded as a not unfair hazard of carrying on a business which may cause pollution on the banks of a river`. The consequences of their commission of the offence, a slick of some 1,500m2, cannot be said to be trivial. Accordingly, I felt that the $10,000 fine imposed by the learned district judge was not manifestly excessive but perfectly reasonable.
Keith Devlin writes that in sentencing for strict liability offences, except where the offence is either trivial or extremely serious, one ends up with a fairly standardized fine, and that the task of the court is to draw a distinction between the `normal` offence where normal penalties should assist, and the relatively unusual case where special considerations ought to apply. I have already stated that in the case of an offender with a series of previous convictions, or one who has committed the offence with complete disregard for any safeguard measures or even intentionally, or one who has managed to create a devastatingly large oil slick resulting in the death of countless marine life, a more severe penalty should be imposed: the maximum penalty provided for in the Act is a fine of $500,000. On the other hand in the case, such as the one before me, of a breach where there have been no such aggravating factors, I am of the view that it would be instructive to standardize the penalty at a fine in the region of $10,000.

This was an appeal against the decision of the learned judicial commissioner Mr Amarjeet Singh convicting the appellant on a charge of trafficking in not less than 24.97g of diamorphine under s 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
On the morning of 19 June 1991, a team of narcotics officers mounted a surveillance operation in the vicinity of a bus-stop along Woodlands Road. The officers took up their respective positions around the area at about 8.45am. Narcotics Officer Juahir bin Ismail (`NO Juahir`) was stationed at the second storey of a deserted shophouse about 20m behind the bus-stop and had a clear view of the bus-stop. Woodlands Road was divided by a fenced barrier with two lanes on either side. Diagonally across from the bus-stop, on the other side of Woodlands Road in the direction of the city, was a community centre. Corporal Wong Chong Yeo (`Cpl Wong`) and two other officers were stationed at different points in the community centre. Cpl Wong had a clear view of the bus-stop some 30-40m away across Woodlands Road. Narcotics Officer Ho Thiam Huat (`NO Ho`) was cruising in his car along this two-way stretch of road. Traffic was light; there were few pedestrians on the road.
At about 10.30am, NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho all saw the appellant walking along the pavement towards the bus-stop in the same direction as the traffic, carrying a white plastic carrier bag which had some sort of markings by its cut-out handles. NO Ho was at the time driving along the extreme left bus lane at about 50kph, and was some 50m away from the bus-stop; he spotted the appellant when the latter was some 5m away from the bus-stop. NO Juahir and Cpl Wong saw the appellant when he was some 10-15m away from the bus-stop. All three of them saw him putting the plastic bag on a seat of the bus-stop, and then going to sit on the railings at the rear of the bus-stop.
When the three officers spotted the appellant at the bus-stop, they alerted their leader, Inspector P Senthilnathan, who then ordered the team to move in to effect arrest. The officers arrested and handcuffed the appellant. From that moment onwards, the appellant did not touch the white plastic bag. When questioned, the appellant denied that the bag was his and any knowledge of its contents. The appellant was brought to the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) at around mid-day. Inspector Alan Moh (`Insp Moh`) took charge of the case as the investigating officer.
The white plastic bag seized from the bus-stop was found to contain a bundle wrapped in a page of the `
 China Press 
` newspaper (dated 18 June 1991). Inside the wrapping was a translucent packet containing some 452g of a granular substance. This was analyzed and found to contain not less than 24.97g of diamorphine. The white plastic bag was dusted for fingerprints. Three latent prints were lifted. The expert evidence showed that one of these prints had been made by the impression of the appellant`s left thumb.
On the afternoon of 19 June 1991, a statement was taken from the appellant under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the s 122(6) statement`). The appellant was subjected to medical examinations before and after the taking of the statement; the reports of the examinations were negative. The s 122(6) statement was not sought to be admitted in evidence at trial. Instead, the prosecution sought to admit a long statement under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the s 121 statement`), which, on the face of it, was taken from the appellant by Insp Moh two days later, on 21 June 1991, between 12.15pm and 3.40pm. The appellant was not medically examined before and after he had made this statement.
The appellant disputed the admissibility of the s 121 statement and a voir dire was held. It is necessary to deal with the voir dire in some detail as the main arguments before us were centred essentially on the admission of this statement in evidence by the trial judge at the conclusion of the voir dire.
Insp Moh gave evidence that on 21 June 1991, at 11.50am, he took the appellant from the lock-up to his office and began the recording of the s 121 statement. This was done by him alone without the service of an interpreter. Insp Moh stated that he had offered an interpreter to the appellant, but the appellant refused, and that as both of them were conversant in Cantonese, the recording of the statement proceeded in that dialect, with Insp Moh translating it into English for the purposes of the recording. After five pages of the statement had been recorded and read back to the appellant in Cantonese, the appellant signed on every page, and both of them had lunch. Afterwards, the appellant asked to make a further statement extending over three pages, and, after this second recording the appellant was returned to the lock-up at 3.40pm.
Insp Krishnan, NO Porter and NO Lim admitted to having taken the appellant from the lock-up in the evening of 19 June 1991 for an interrogation session. They said, however, that the purpose of interrogating the appellant was to gather intelligence about other drug traffickers which the appellant might have knowledge of, and not to extract a confession from the appellant. They denied that they had assaulted the appellant to make him confess and had fabricated the s 121 statement.
The evidence of the appellant at the voir dire was this. On 19 June 1991, NO Porter had taken him from the lock-up at about 6.35pm before he could have dinner. He had not eaten since breakfast on the morning he was arrested. He was taken to an office with his hands handcuffed behind his back, and interrogated by the three officers in Hokkien and was urged to confess. When he denied that the drugs were his, NO Porter and NO Lim assaulted him continuously for 15-25 minutes, punching him in the stomach and kicking his legs. He was severely assaulted and the pain was unbearable. He was very hungry and asked for food, saying that if they gave him food he would do whatever they wanted. One of them went to fetch food and it was given to him an hour later.
NO Porter then typed the statement in the appellant`s presence, making reference to a small piece of paper, 8.5"" by 5"". Although NO Porter kept asking him questions while typing the statement, he merely replied that he would sign whatever NO Porter typed. NO Porter then read the statement out to him in Hokkien, and he signed on every page. In cross-examination, he stated that the s 121 statement before the court was the same document as the statement he had signed, except that, when he signed it, some space on the first page of the statement had been left blank.
The appellant further testified that, as a result of the assault on him, he sustained a huge bruise of some 10-12cm in diameter on the right side of his rib cage. He said that it caused him intense pain that came and went. He did not report this to the officers-in-charge on his return to the lock-up because he was in pain. He reported it to an officer the next day but nothing was done. He informed a cell-mate, Ong Kee Kwok (`Ong`), of the assault and showed him his bruise. The appellant also said that on his remand at Queenstown Remand Prison two weeks later, he still felt the pain, and asked to see a doctor there, but, again, nothing was done.
The appellant explained that at 11.50am on 21 June 1991, Insp Moh took him out from the lock-up to his office not to take the statement as alleged by the prosecution, but to have the statement, which had already been typed by NO Porter, read over to him. There was no interpreter present, and both of them spoke in Cantonese, which Insp Moh had elected to use. He told Insp Moh that there was no need to read the statement to him as he knew what it said. Thereafter, Insp Moh gave him tea and cakes and they chatted about inconsequential matters until he was returned to the lock-up at 3.40pm.
Ong was called as a defence witness and gave supportive testimony for the appellant. He said that, at the material time, he shared a cell with the appellant in the lock-up at the Central Police Station. The appellant told him that he had been assaulted by the CNB officers and showed him the redness and bruise in his stomach. He called the police and, thereafter, he retreated to leave the appellant to talk to the police. He did not hear the conversation. The police did nothing.
At the end of the voir dire, the trial judge reviewed the evidence of the prosecution and defence in great detail and evaluated it thus. First, on the alleged deprivation of food and assault by NO Porter and NO Lim, he found inconsistencies in the appellant`s evidence. He held that if it were true that the appellant was assaulted continuously for 15-25 minutes, a reasonable reaction from the appellant would have been that he would sign anything if they stopped assaulting him. That was not what the appellant said; the appellant said that if they gave him food he would sign whatever they wanted from him. The trial judge accepted NO Porter`s evidence that he recorded in his diary that food was provided to the appellant at 7.00pm and this was not challenged. The only meal the appellant missed was lunch and that, the trial judge held, in the rush of an on-going investigation was of no significant consequence.
Secondly, on the question of assault, the trial judge held that the appellant had failed to complain to PC Abdul Nazir and W/CP Ong Peck Geok, the officers-in-charge at the Central Police Station`s lock-up, on his return to the lock-up although he claimed he was in great pain; one would reasonably expect him to complain and seek medical attention if the assault and pain had been as severe as he had made it out to be. The trial judge also found his other evidence relating to the assault incongruous and that he was not telling the truth. As for the evidence of Ong, the trial judge found that, save for supporting `the main strands` of the appellant`s allegations, Ong`s evidence was very thin on details and differed from the appellant`s on several material points and in one material point there was a sharp contradiction between the two. The trial judge was of the view that there was little doubt that the medical staff of the prison would have allowed the appellant to see a doctor if he had alleged assault at the police station and was in pain. The trial judge said: 
 
I was of the opinion, in the circumstances, that the accused was untruthful 
 in alleging the assaults
 at the eleventh hour and the contradictions in his evidence and his conduct and behaviour after the alleged assault and the evidence of his witness totally lacked credibility and his allegations did not raise any reasonable doubt in my mind of their truthfulness in respect of the said assault.
 
 
 
On the alleged fabrication of the s 121 statement, the trial judge stated that he was thoroughly unimpressed with the appellant`s allegations. The most damning piece of evidence against the appellant, the trial judge held, was the appellant`s own allegation that the statement had been completely fabricated by NO Porter, as he had told NO Porter to type what he wanted and that he would sign it. It was a fact that the statement contained detailed information about the appellant`s personal background which he later admitted to be true, and which were thus incapable of fabrication by NO Porter. The trial judge was of the view that the appellant had realized this in cross-examination and had come up with the story that NO Porter, when typing the statement, referred to the `piece of paper, 8.5"" by 5""`, which must have contained details of his personal particulars that he had revealed to Insp Moh when giving his s 122(6) statement earlier that afternoon, and with which Insp Moh must have provided NO Porter. The trial judge accepted the evidence of NO Porter, Inspector Krishnan and NO Lim as being frank and truthful and disbelieved the appellant`s version of the events.
The trial judge rejected the appellant`s allegation that the document typed by NO Porter which he had signed had blanks in the spaces for date, time and name of recording officer, which had since been filled in falsely, since the appellant had admitted he could not read English, and when he was shown the statement at the trial, he said that all he could recognize on the document was his name, `Lim`.
The trial judge further rejected the appellant`s allegation that Insp Moh had taken him out from the lock-up merely to read the statement over to him; if the statement had been made earlier and had already been signed by the appellant as alleged, then obviously there was no need for further co-operation from the appellant. Equally unlikely was the appellant`s account of his spending the length of time between 11.50am until 3.40pm merely chatting with Insp Moh, and eating cakes and drinking tea.
The trial judge accordingly held that the s 121 statement was made voluntarily and admitted it in evidence. The content of the statement, so far as material, was as follows. The appellant admitted to agreeing with one Seow Kia to smuggle drugs into Singapore from Johor Bahru for $4,500 per pound. Seow Kia had contacted him through a pager which his friend Ah Seong (a Singaporean drug purchaser) had given him. The appellant met Seow Kia at Beauty World in Upper Bukit Timah at 8pm on 18 June 1991, and agreed to meet him with the drugs at the bus-stop in Woodlands at 10.30am the next day. The appellant then returned to Johor Bahru to look for a heroin supplier he knew by the name Seow Chern. He found Seow Chern at the Cathay Cinema shortly after 9 pm; Seow Chern had heroin wrapped in newspaper stored behind the driver`s seat of his car, and was able to meet the appellant`s request for heroin. The appellant left with the drugs for Singapore the next morning at 9am. He took a lift down to the Woodlands checkpoint from a fellow lorry driver, and then took a taxi from there to the bus-stop where he had arranged to meet Seow Kia. He put the bag containing the drugs on the bus-stop seat `as a precautionary measure` and sat on the railings at the rear of the bus-stop. Ten minutes later, he was arrested by the CNB officers.
In his defence, the appellant maintained that he had nothing to do with the drugs found at the bus-stop and that he merely happened to have come upon them there. He testified that, on the morning of 19 June 1991, he left his home in Kulai for the Nam Hong Plywood Factory (`the factory`) in Jurong, Singapore, to make enquiries as to whether the factory needed sawdust. His employer had been supplying the factory with sawdust for seven years, but had since stopped; the appellant claimed that he had in view the setting up of his own business and supplying the factory himself. He said he drove from Kulai but parked his car in Johor Bahru and hitched a ride from across the Causeway to the factory from a fellow lorry driver known as `Ah Pui`.
When the appellant reached the factory, he spoke to an employee known as `Ismail`, although he did not go to see the factory manager, `Gan`. He first said that it was too early; then he said that it was pointless to see Gan as he had not bought his lorry yet. He stated he left the factory at 9.30am and had a cup of tea at a canteen next door. There, he met a pick-up driver who gave him a lift to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road so that he could take the Service 170 bus back to Johor Bahru.
As the appellant approached the bus-stop, seven or eight passengers were boarding a bus. When he reached the bus-stop, the appellant noticed a white plastic bag had been left on the middle seat. He thought that it had been left behind by one of the passengers who had got onto the bus, which had since moved off, leaving him alone at the stop. Out of curiosity he touched and then opened the bag, thinking it contained a ladies` wallet; inside, he saw a newspaper wrapped bundle which he also opened and saw something like salt. He said that he had replaced the bag on the seat and was sitting on the bus-stop railings when he was arrested by CNB officers. He maintained that, instead of immediately handcuffing him, the officers first insisted that he pick up the plastic bag and take a look inside; they told him it was drugs.
The appellant denied having had at any time possession of the bag; he asserted that the inculpatory parts of the s 121 statement were fabricated and untrue. He denied knowing the persons Seow Kia, Seow Chern and Ah Seong.
The defence called one Sheo Poh Hong who had given the appellant a lift from the factory to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road. This witness testified that the appellant did not carry a white plastic bag when he met the appellant at the canteen. However, his account of the circumstances surrounding the meeting that morning was regarded by the trial judge as being `highly improbable`, differing from the appellant`s at material points. He also admitted to meeting the appellant next at Queenstown Remand Prison, and admitted that he recognized the appellant and remembered the incident when he was reminded by the appellant.
The trial judge was satisfied that the appellant`s possession of the white plastic bag containing the drugs had been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the following: the evidence of NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho, the fingerprint evidence, and the main inculpatory parts of the s 121 statement, in which the appellant admitted to possession of the drugs and to transporting them from Johor Bahru to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road to deliver them to Seow Kia. He said: 
 
Having thus reviewed and assessed the whole evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case in respect of the basic ingredient of possession by the accused of the plastic bag with the diamorphine in it beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, the presumed facts under the Misuse of Drugs Act that the accused had knowledge of the diamorphine in the plastic bag and additionally, the presumed facts that the accused, having more than 2g of diamorphine, was presumed to be trafficking in it, in combination with the proved facts, amongst which was the offer of delivery by the accused as stated in the charge, had not been rebutted by the accused.
 
 
 
Before us, counsel for the appellant took issue with the admission of the s 121 statement and contended that the trial judge erred in finding that the s 121 statement had been made voluntarily. He advanced two main arguments against such finding. First, he submitted that that part of the judgment in which the trial judge held that the appellant had been `untruthful in alleging the assaults at the eleventh hour`, ie only at trial, was unfair to the appellant, since a copy of the s 121 statement was given to defence counsel only three days before the commencement of the trial, and the appellant could not have raised the allegations of assault earlier; the appellant did not know, and would not have known, whether the prosecution intended to rely on the s 121 statement until the trial itself.
We think that counsel had misunderstood that part of the judgment. The trial judge in holding that the appellant raised the allegation of assault at the `eleventh hour` was not referring to the fact that the allegations had not been made earlier in the proceedings, such as at the preliminary inquiry, but the fact that the allegations or complaints had not been made to the officers on duty at the lock-up at the Central Police Station immediately after the alleged assault or soon thereafter at any time as would have been reasonably expected of a person so assaulted in police custody. The trial judge was fully aware that a copy of the s 121 statement was given to the defence shortly before trial commenced. At the commencement of the trial, defence counsel asked for an adjournment on the ground, inter alia, that a copy of the s 121 statement was furnished to him shortly before the trial and he required time to take instructions from the appellant. This request received sympathetic consideration from the trial judge and an adjournment was granted to defence counsel to take instructions from the appellant. In our judgment, this argument had no merit, and we rejected it.
We now turn to the second main argument advanced on behalf of the appellant. It was contended that adverse inferences should have been drawn from the failure of Insp Moh (i) to ensure that an interpreter was present while he was taking the s 121 statement from the appellant, and (ii) to send the appellant for a medical examination both before and after the making of the statement. Counsel pointed out that both these safeguards had been taken by Insp Moh when the appellant made his s 122(6) statement. Under cross-examination, Insp Moh explained that medical examinations before and after the s 122(6) statement were `a procedural requirement ... but not [for] s 121`. Counsel submitted that this was an arbitrary distinction, as s 121 statement carried the same evidentiary weight as s 122(6) statement, and as, particularly, the purpose for having the requirement of pre- and post-statement medical examinations was to ensure that an accused had not been assaulted and compelled to give the statement. Counsel accordingly urged us to draw the inference, to the extent that a reasonable doubt would be raised, that Insp Moh, who was an experienced and prudent officer, failed to ensure the presence of an interpreter (who would have been an independent person) at the time the statement was recorded, because the statement had already been prepared, and that he failed to send the appellant for medical examinations before and after the taking of the statement, because the examinations would have revealed the assaults on the appellant. Counsel submitted that the explanations given by Insp Moh of his behaviour, taken with the corroborating evidence of Ong, were sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the trial judge`s mind as to the voluntariness of the statement.
Although we could see the force of counsel`s argument, we are not persuaded that the trial judge`s finding was in error. The evidence before him was not solely that of Insp Moh. There was also the evidence of NO Porter, Insp Krishnan and NO Lim. The trial judge had considered with great care the evidence of NO Porter, Inspector Krishnan and NO Lim, and found that their evidence was frank and truthful; he disbelieved the evidence of the appellant on the alleged assault and fabrication of the s 121 statement. The trial judge had also considered carefully the evidence of Insp Moh, who had been vigorously cross-examined as to why there were no pre- and post-statement medical examinations and why there was no interpreter around at the material time, and he had accepted Insp Moh`s evidence. The trial judge had seen and heard these witnesses and he had evaluated their evidence. In our judgment, the trial judge was well entitled on the evidence before him to reach the conclusion that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statement had been made voluntarily.
We revert to the facts in the instant case. Although the trial judge considered that possession had been made out by the evidence taken as a whole, we were of the opinion that, even without the s 121 statement, the evidence of NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho, who had seen the appellant carrying the bag and placing it on the middle seat at the bus-stop, and the expert evidence of the appellant`s fingerprint on the paper bag - all this evidence was unassailable - would have constituted sufficient evidence to raise a strong inference that the appellant knew the contents of the paper bag and, therefore, had possession of the drugs found there, and he had not given any explanation as to the contents of the bag which was accepted by the trial judge. On this point, we would refer to the oft-quoted passage of the speech of Lord Pearce in 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
1 at pp 305-306: 
 
... If a man is in possession of the contents of a package, prima facie his possession of the package leads to the strong inference that he is in possession of its contents. But can this be rebutted by evidence that he was mistaken as to its contents? ... Thus the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open it and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents.
 
 
 
More apposite to the facts in this case is the following passage of the judgment of this Court in 
 Tan Ah Tee & Anor v PP 
, at p 52, where Wee Chong Jin CJ said: 
 
With regard to the question of possession of the contents of the plastic bag, it is submitted that the trial judges should have drawn the inference from her evidence that she did not in fact know what was contained inside the plastic bag. In our opinion there was no plausible evidence before the trial judges to require them to draw the inference that she was an innocent custodian of the contents of the plastic bag. Indeed, even if there were no statutory presumptions available to the prosecution, once the prosecution had proved the fact of physical control or possession of the plastic bag and the circumstances in which this was acquired by and remained with the second appellant, the trial judges would be justified in finding that she had possession of the contents of the plastic bag within the meaning of the Act unless she gave an explanation of the physical fact which the trial judges accepted or which raised a doubt in their minds that she had possession of the contents within the meaning of the Act.
 
 
 
That precisely was what had happened in this case. The appellant was in physical possession and control of the plastic bag; he was found carrying the plastic bag on the way to the bus-stop and then placing the bag on the middle seat at the bus-stop and his left thumb print was found on the plastic bag and drugs were found in the plastic bag. A strong inference irresistibly arose that he knew the contents of the bag, and he had not given `any explanation of the physical fact` which the trial judge accepted or which raised a doubt in his mind. His evidence that that was not his bag and that he had nothing to do with it was rejected, and the trial judge was justified in rejecting it. Once possession was proved, as, in our opinion, it had been proved in this case, the presumption of trafficking in the drugs under s 17 of the Act arose which the appellant had to rebut on a balance of probabilities, and he had failed to rebut it.

Cur Adv Vult
 
Before the High Court the respondent, Victor Rajoo (the accused), faced five charges, namely: (i) a charge of abduction of a lady, whom we shall call `AB`, with intent that she might be forced to illicit sexual intercourse, an offence punishable under s 366 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (the Code); (ii) a charge of having carnal intercourse with AB against the order of nature, an offence punishable under s 377 of the Code; (iii) a charge of rape of AB and putting her in fear of hurt to herself, an offence punishable under s 376(2)(b) of the Code; (iv) a charge of robbery of $6000 from AB, an offence punishable under s 392 of the Code; and (v) a charge of theft of other items belonging to AB under s 379 of the Code. The accused claimed trial to the first four charges but pleaded guilty to the fifth charge, namely, that of theft. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial judge acquitted him of the first and third charges, but convicted him of the second charge and sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of six months and a fine of two thousand dollars. In respect of the fourth charge, the accused was acquitted of the charge of robbery but was convicted on an amended charge of theft under s 379 of the Code and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years which was to run consecutively to the term of six months. In respect of the theft charge to which the accused pleaded guilty, he was convicted and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years which was to run concurrently with the term of imprisonment passed on the amended fourth charge.
The Public Prosecutor now appeals against the decision of the learned trial judge in acquitting the accused of the first and third charges and in amending the fourth charge to one of theft and convicting the accused of that charge. It is necessary in this appeal to set out in some detail the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defence respectively and to deal with it at some length.
 The prosecution case
We turn first to the evidence of AB, the complainant. She is an Indian national, aged 44 years, and was at the material time in Singapore on a social visit pass. She is married with two children and does trading business for a living. She came to Singapore to purchase goods for her business sometime in January 1995, but that was not her first visit. During that visit, she stayed at a lodging house at No 28, Veerasamy Road. She bought some hair clips and sunglasses to sell them in Sri Lanka.
On 22 January 1995 at about 11am, AB was walking along Hampshire Road carrying two plastic bags which contained her various personal effects and other items. A motor van driven by the accused, who was dressed in a long sleeved sports shirt and bermuda shorts, came and stopped next to her. The accused asked AB whether she was from India and also where she had just come from, and she replied that she had gone to see someone to collect some money. The accused asked whether she had a visa, to which she replied in the affirmative. He then asked to see her visa and also demanded her passport. In response she asked who he was, and he replied that he was a police officer. When she said that he did not look like a police officer, he claimed that he was from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). She did not believe him and asked him to show his identification card. He flashed a card to identify himself but quickly put it back into his pocket. She then believed the accused`s claim that he was a police officer and handed over her passport as demanded, and told him that she would be returning to India the following day. He examined the passport and claimed that he had checked her at the airport police station two weeks ago, and that she had come to Singapore on a different passport. The accused then asked her to board his van so that he could bring her to the airport police station for an investigation. He said that after the investigation he would release her. When she refused to board the van, the accused threatened to handcuff her. On hearing this, she was frightened and boarded the van.
The accused drove the van along Serangoon Road, passed Sim Lim Towers and drove all the way towards the Changi Airport. After having travelled for about half an hour, the accused stopped the van. He then pointed to a building and told AB that that was where the police station was located. The accused told AB to go and sit in the rear compartment of the van, and explained that when police officers were bringing in someone for questioning, they were not supposed to have the person seated in the front cabin. AB left her two plastic bags in front and went into the rear compartment.
After AB had gone into the rear compartment, the van travelled for a short distance and went over a very bumpy road. At this point AB was concerned and she asked the accused in sign language after tapping at the window separating the two compartments where he was heading. The accused pointed his index finger at her and she assumed that he was going to answer a call of nature. When the van stopped, she noticed that there were a lot of trees around. It was `like a jungle area`.
The accused then went into the rear compartment, sat near the side door, removed his shoes and told AB that he had to check her. She told him to bring her to the police station and have a female officer to check her. The accused refused. AB became frightened. The accused then pulled at her saree, and as a result the saree came off. She pleaded with the accused. The accused abused her and instead pulled off her petticoat. He then ordered her to remove her blouse and brassiere. When she refused, the accused placed his hands on her neck and told her that he would kill her and throw her into the bushes. AB became frightened and therefore complied. The accused then undressed himself and went towards AB. She sat on the floorboard to avoid him and at this stage, the accused stepped on her ankle and repeated that he would kill her if she resisted. The accused then forced AB to submit to performing an act of fellatio on him (the subject of the second charge). AB accordingly did what she was told. Following that the accused raped her.
Thereafter, the accused handed AB her clothes and as she was dressing he noticed a knot at one end of her saree. He took the saree, untied the knot and found S$6,000 in it and took the money. AB tried to snatch it back but he pushed her away, and as a result she fell. After they had dressed, he went back to the driver`s seat and she followed him. He asked her to shut the rear compartment door. She went into the rear compartment. She then saw a card and delivery order attached to a flower basket in the van. She took the card and delivery order. When she alighted from the van, she went to the rear of the van and noted the vehicle number, `YG 1496M`. She then went to the front of the vehicle to confirm the number. By this time the accused had started to drive off with AB`s two bags still in the van at the front. She then went out to the main road and flagged for help from passing vehicles. Eventually, a car driven by one Simon Tay Seong Chee, a lecturer with the Law Faculty of the National University of Singapore, came along. With Simon Tay in the car were his wife, Siow Jin Hua, and a friend. They found AB in distress and brought her to the nearest police station, the airport police station. Inside the car, she borrowed a pen and scribbled `YG 1496M` on a piece of paper.
Simon Tay and his wife both gave evidence. Simon Tay testified that at the material time he was driving his motor car SBA 2180X from Changi Village with his wife seated next to him and a friend on the rear seat. Whilst travelling along Changi Coast Road, a short distance from the SIA hangars and somewhere near the entrance leading to a construction site, he saw a female Indian standing on the road `waving her arms in the air, using her hands to beat her chest` and trying to flag the passing vehicles. At first Simon Tay drove past her but immediately slowed down and observed from the rear mirror that she was in distress. After a brief consultation with his wife and his friend he turned around, drove up to her and stopped beside her. He noticed that AB was distressed and emotional, and uttered some words in broken English to the effect that someone had taken her passport, money and air ticket. She said that she was from India and needed help. She kept repeating `police` as she could hardly speak English. Realizing that she needed help Simon Tay asked her to board the car. She boarded the car and sat on the rear seat. She asked for a piece of paper and pen. Siow Jin Hua gave her a pen and she wrote down several numbers on a portion of a newspaper which was in the car. Throughout the journey she kept on talking in broken English and Simon Tay came to understand that the culprit had taken her things and had identified himself as a policeman. On reaching the police station, Simon Tay referred her to some police officers. She became more distressed and started crying.
Siow Jin Hua confirmed in substance what her husband said. She also said that AB was very upset, spoke very incoherently and cried and gestured a great deal.
At the Airport Police Division Headquarters on that day the police officer, Abdul Karim bin Senin, was on duty when AB was brought in by Simon Tay. According to Abdul Karim, AB upon entering the report room started to cry, and `due to her emotional state`, he was unable to gather sufficient facts from her. He therefore sought the assistance of Staff Sergeant AR Rajagopal and contacted the latter, who was then on duty at Changi Airport Terminal 2. S/Sgt Rajagopal spoke to AB over the telephone and interviewed her. After that, S/Sgt Rajagopal briefed Abdul Karim on the facts of the case and the latter transcribed in the station diary what S/Sgt Rajagopal had told him. The information as recorded was as follows: 
 
... She was raped and robbed by a male Indian, aged 28 to 30 years old. Dark complexion, hair touching collar and wearing white T-shirt with bermuda shorts, black sandals and left ear with two studs. She was picked up by him at Sim Lim Tower and brought her to Changi Coast Road, raped and robbed. Cash $6,000, luggage and a passport. The subject was in a white van No YG1496M ...
 
 
 
Abdul Karim then referred AB to ASP Teo Chor Leng of Bedok Police Station Headquarters.
S/Sgt Rajagopal testified that when he interviewed AB on the telephone in Tamil she was emotional and was crying. AB actually mentioned the robbery first. He asked her to be forthcoming and not to hide anything. She was very emotional and was crying and hysterical. He managed to gather from her that an unknown male Indian in a van YG 1496M had raped her and then robbed her of $6000, her passport and luggage. After the interview he briefed Abdul Karim of the facts. Later on the same day, S/Sgt Rajagopal went to Airport Police Division Headquarters to act as an interpreter to ASP Teo Chor Leng, when the latter interviewed AB. At that time, she handed to ASP Teo the delivery order and congratulatory card from Noel Gift International Ltd, which she took from the rear compartment of the van.
ASP Teo confirmed that on that day he interviewed AB with the assistance of S/Sgt Rajagopal, and gathered from her that she had been raped and robbed at Changi Coast Road and that the culprit was a male Indian and had escaped in a motor van YG 1496M. AB handed to him a Noel Gift International Ltd delivery order and a congratulatory card. ASP Teo said that AB was very emotional and was sobbing during the interview.
The investigating officer was Inspector Deep Singh, attached to the organized crime branch of the CID. He took over the investigation from ASP Teo. On 24 January 1995 he recorded two statements from the accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (s 122(6) statements) in answer to the charges of rape and robbery respectively. These statements were admitted in evidence after a voir dire held to determine that the accused had made them without any inducement, threat or promise. The s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of rape was as follows: 
 
I admit that I brought her. We went in a vehicle. I do not frighten her but I told her that I was a policeman. When she heard this she became frightened. I asked her for her passport. I then told her to go behind the vehicle. When I told her this, she told me that she knew why I told her this. I do not know why she said this. It may be because I told her that I am a policeman. I did not force her or persuade to do this. I wanted to have sex with her that is why I told her to go behind the vehicle. The reason she agreed to follow because I told her I am a policeman. I did not beat or threatened her.
 
 
 
The s 122(6) statement in answer to the charge for robbery was a short one, which was as follows: 
 
I admit committing the offence of robbery. I plead for leniency.
 
 
 
For the purpose of this appeal only the following parts of the evidence of Inspector Deep Singh are relevant. He testified, inter alia, that on 31 January 1995 the accused led him to the scene of the crime, off Changi Coast Road. The accused also led him to a spot at the side of the road which is about 70m from Changi Ferry Road. There, he told Inspector Deep Singh that that was where he stopped his van and asked his victim to alight from the front cabin and board the rear compartment of the van. He also told the inspector that that was where he (the accused) pointed the SIA Engineering Building to the victim as the building where Changi Airport Police Station was located, which was their destination.
Inspector Deep Singh also made an investigation concerning AB. He went to No 28 Veerasamy Road and ascertained that AB at that time was staying in a room there. He found an assortment of hair clips and sunglasses in her room. He also ascertained that goods had indeed been bought by AB from several shops in Singapore. At two of the shops, the staff recognized her and confirmed she had made purchases from them regularly. In fact, he also managed to obtain copies of two receipts of those purchases from one of the shops. One of the receipts bore her name.
One, Terrence Tan Choon How, the manager of a company or firm Pacific Polythene, testified that the accused was one of the company`s employees at the material time. The accused`s job was to deliver goods of the company and had been entrusted the company`s van No YG 1496M. He confirmed that on 22 January 1995 the van was in the accused`s custody, and that besides the accused Tan himself was the only person holding a key to the van.
Lim Phay Inn Suzanne, the transport supervisor of Noel Gift International Ltd, gave evidence on the delivery order and the congratulatory card which AB took from the rear compartment of the van. Lim said that her company employed Guan Delivery Services for delivery of company`s gifts and the accused was a part time staff of Guan Delivery Services. She said that on 22 January 1995 at about 10.40am the accused left her office with a gift item for delivery to one Susan Hoong of No 6 Sin Min Plaza #04-09. She also confirmed that the delivery order and gift card produced to her subsequently by Inspector Deep Singh on 16 May 1995 were the delivery order and gift card used by her company and were attached to the gift item which the accused was supposed to deliver to Susan Hoong.
 The defence case
The accused gave evidence in his defence, and his evidence was this. On 22 January 1995, as he was driving the van along Hampshire Road approaching the junction of Rutland Road, he saw AB on the other side of the road. He called out to her and signalled to her to go over to him. In response she gestured to him to go to her instead. He thereupon turned his van around and drove up to her and stopped by her side. He asked her where she was going and in reply she said that she was going to her room. He then asked whether they could go to the room. She said that her room was at Veerasamy Road. He asked her to board his van and she did so. Neither of them indicated at that point where they would be heading, but the accused drove past Veerasamy Road along Race Course Road, Serangoon Road and Kitchener Road. When the van passed Veerasamy Road, AB gave no indication that she wished to be let off. During the journey they continued chatting and the subject turned on the bags that AB was carrying with her and her selling of sarees. The accused continued driving and eventually took his van to East Coast Parkway. They were chatting casually. He asked whether she was afraid as she was selling things such as gold and sarees. She said she was not afraid and asked whether he was a policeman. He replied that he was not. Later in the course of the conversation pertaining to her trips to and from India she produced her passport and gave it to him to have a look. The accused looked at it and then placed it on the dashboard. Finally, they reached Changi Coast Road where the accused stopped the van. There he asked AB to alight and get into the rear compartment of the van and informed her that he would take her to the place where they would have sexual intercourse. He then drove a short distance to a vacant land where he parked the van. He got down and joined her in the rear compartment.
The accused said that when he entered the rear compartment, AB was seated, and she asked him: `Why come all the way here? If you have said we could have gone to a room`. To that he replied: `We are already here, we have already arrived here, we will be here`. He said that they would `sleep` there - by that he meant having sexual intercourse - to which she agreed. He then asked her to undress. AB was initially bashful, as it was bright but she was quickly persuaded by him that no one would see them. After she had undressed herself, she asked the accused why he had not similarly done so; so he too undressed himself. He asked if she would `suck`. Without saying a word, she picked up a cloth beside them, wiped his penis and performed oral sex. They then had sexual intercourse. Thereafter, while she was dressing, he noticed a knot at one end of her saree and asked to see it, and on untying it he found some Singapore currency. He took the money without counting and put it into his right pocket. She tried to snatch it back from him but failed. In the process, she ripped off part of his pocket, lost her balance, and fell into a sitting position on the floorboard of the van. He then got out and told her to go to the front passenger seat and that he would then return her the money. She indicated that she wanted to stay in the rear compartment. He then reversed his van to get out of the vacant land. While doing so he saw through the side mirror AB jumping out of the van and running to the main road. He tried to call her but when he saw her waving to passing vehicles he got frightened and drove off.
With regard to his s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of rape, the accused said that he did not tell AB that he was a policeman. What he said was: `What if I were a policeman` and that was said in the context of asking AB if she was afraid when she said that she brought in gold and sarees to sell in Singapore. In respect of the s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of robbery he said that he was guilty of theft.
 Decision below
The learned trial judge accepted the evidence of the accused as being closer to the truth. He found that the accused came across as an honest witness, and he did not believe AB when she said that she thought that the silver panelled van was a police vehicle. He was also not convinced that her business of selling mangoes for a profit of $75 justified her trip to Singapore. The learned trial judge noted, however, that on this particular trip, she brought nothing to sell, but purchased hair clips and sunglasses for sale in Colombo. He was, therefore, sceptical about the profits she could make there. He could not say with certainty if the latter was the real purpose of her visit to Singapore. AB conveyed an impression that she was not entirely forthright.
The learned trial judge also noted that no weapon was used in any way. There was not a single scratch on either the accused or AB. The only damage was to the accused`s pocket when AB tried to snatch back her money. The learned trial judge expressed surprise that AB who did not put up any resistance when she was raped as alleged, would find the courage or strength to resist when her money was being taken. Her distress when Simon Tay found her appeared to be over the loss of her money. She herself testified that she repeated `Help! Police! Cheating!` to Simon Tay and his wife. She did not take the opportunity to escape when the van stopped two or three times on the way to East Coast Parkway. No attempt was made to flee from the accused until after her money had been taken from her. Her disposition and character before and up to the rape was in marked contrast to that displayed the moment the accused took her $6,000. The evidence as a whole, had not only created a doubt in the learned trial judge`s mind t hat AB did not consent to travel in the accused`s van or to the sexual acts, but also convinced him that in all probability she did consent. He said: 
 
The evidence as a whole, has not only created a doubt in my mind that AB did not consent to travel in the accused`s van or to the sexual acts, but I am convinced that in all probability she did consent.
 
 
 
The prosecution has therefore, not proved that AB was abducted for illicit sexual intercourse or that the accused had sexual intercourse with AB without her consent. Accordingly, I acquitted the accused of the first and third charges.
Turning to the fourth charge of robbery of the sum of $6,000, the learned trial judge held thus: 
 
In respect of the fourth charge of robbery of the $6,000, it was clear in the evidence that the threat of death or hurt or the wrongful restraint if at all (which I found otherwise) related only to the sexual acts. The taking of the money was an off-chance. It came about, even from the evidence of AB, when she was dressing up, the accused found the money and took it. This cannot fall within the definition of `Robbery` under s 390. In this regard, I accept the evidence of the accused that he did not push AB when she tried to snatch the money from him. It is a case of theft simpliciter under s 378. I, therefore, convicted the accused accordingly, and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for two years.
 
 
 
 
 The appeal
 
The appeal is essentially against the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge. Basically there are three main issues: first, whether AB was induced by deception on the part of the accused to travel in the accused`s van; second, whether AB consented to having sexual intercourse with the accused; and third, whether the accused put AB in any fear of hurt to herself when the accused took the sum of $6000 from her by force. The first is relevant to the charge of abduction; the second to the charge of rape; and the third to the charge of robbery.
In a case such as this, there was obviously a conflict between the evidence of the complainant and that of the accused. The learned trial judge, who had had the benefit of seeing and hearing the complainant and the accused giving evidence made findings of fact based on the veracity and credibility of their respective evidence. Due regard must be given to the learned trial judge`s findings, and such findings should not be disturbed unless we are satisfied that he has clearly reached a wrong decision. In at pp 333-334, Lai Kew Chai J delivering the judgment of this court said: 
 
... In a case such as the instant case, where there were two directly contradictory versions the acceptance or rejection of which significantly depended on the oral testimony of the protagonists, the role of the appellate court is clear. We have to accord to the findings of facts of the learned trial judge the greatest respect and ought not disturb them unless we are satisfied that the learned trial judge had reached a wrong decision and that in the context of this case `any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge`s conclusion`: see the speech of Lord Thankerton in 
[1947] AC 484
, at p 488, reported under the name of or .
 
 
 
Pronouncements to similar effect were made by this court in , at p 42 and , at p 5. Having said this, nonetheless, it is incumbent on us to examine the basis of the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge and his reasons therefor and consider whether the findings were against the weight of evidence and insupportable.
We turn first to the primary facts which have been established and which are not in dispute. The accused, prior to the morning of 22 January 1995, was not acquainted with AB at all. On that day, while driving along Hampshire Road he saw AB on the opposite side. He accosted her and drove up to her side. A conversation then took place, and he requested her to board the van which she did. He then drove the van all the way to Changi Coast Road. Somewhere along that road, he stopped the van and asked her to alight and go to the rear compartment, and she complied. He then drove the van further and stopped at an isolated spot and parked the van there. After that he went to the rear compartment, and there, three important events took place. First, at his request AB performed the fellatio on him; second, they had sexual intercourse; and third, as she was dressing up, he found some money of hers tied in a knot in her saree and he took the money against her will. After she had dressed up and the accused had left the rear compartment, she picked up a delivery order and a card attached to a flower basket and kept them. She came down from the van and noted the number of the van. She then went to the main road and flagged down passing vehicles for help. She was picked up by Simon Tay driving his car who had with him his wife and a friend. They took her to a police station, where she made a report.
It is now necessary to consider and test the evidence of AB and the accused respectively against the undisputed facts and other evidence before us. AB`s evidence, in substance, was that she was going about her business on the morning of 22 January 1995, and along Hampshire Road she was accosted by the accused who drove a van and stopped by her side. The accused told her that he was a police officer and asked for her visa and passport. She produced her passport and gave it to him; he inspected it and then placed it on the front dashboard and asked her to board the van as he was going to bring her in for further investigation. She believed him and under the threat of being handcuffed by him she boarded the van. On the other hand, the accused`s evidence was that he accosted her, asked her where she was going and on hearing that she was going to her room in Veerasamy Road suggested that they should go to her room. He then asked her to board the van and she did so willingly.
Considering purely the respective evidence of AB and the accused, we have difficulty in accepting what the accused said. If his evidence is tested against the primary facts which are uncontroverted, and other evidence it is even more incredible. The accused was a total stranger to AB; he accosted her by the road side. She was not at the material time standing by the road side accosting or trying to accost any man coming along, or for that matter any passer-by, male or female. She was going about in her business and was going to her destination, whether it be her room in Veerasamy Road or elsewhere. AB`s evidence, on the other hand, was more consistent with the primary facts.
Next, there was the s 122(6) statement of the accused made in answer to the charge of rape. It was not in dispute that the accused made this statement voluntarily. What he disputed was the content of the statement. He said he did not tell AB that he was a policeman and that what he said was: `What if I were a policeman` and that was said in the context of asking AB if she was afraid when she said that she had brought gold and sarees to sell in Singapore. Both Inspector Deep Singh, the investigating officer, and B Jeyaletchumi, the interpreter, were called and were cross-examined on what the accused had said. The learned trial judge reached the following conclusion: 
 
The interpreter, Jeyaletchumi, was cross-examined and she said she could not remember if the accused`s version in court was what he told her on 24 January 1995. I have noted that the statement was translated by her `sentence by sentence`. However, she appeared to me to be unsure and was not prepared to say categorically that the accused`s version was not true or wrong. The accused impressed me as an honest witness and I am, therefore, giving him the benefit of the doubt. Furthermore, he did say explicitly, that he did not `force her or persuade` AB to have sex nor did he `beat or threaten` her. It is to be remembered that the charge (in P53) to which this statement relates alleges that he `put the said [AB] in fear of hurt to herself`.
 
 
 
With respect, we have difficulty in accepting this conclusion. First, Jeyaletchumi`s role was only that of a translator: translating what the accused said in Tamil into English, and vice versa. That statement was recorded on 24 January 1995. It is not possible to expect her to remember and testify in court some five months later whether the accused`s version in court was what he said to her in January 1995. Nor could she testify whether `categorically` or otherwise `that the accused`s version was not true or wrong`. All she could say, and did say, was that she translated what the accused said in Tamil into English. She said that the statement was recorded sentence by sentence and she translated sentence by sentence. She further testified that the statement was read back and translated to the accused and he did not indicate that he wished to make any correction. It is obvious to us that she relied on that statement to refresh her memory. We can find no basis for saying that the s 122(6) statement did not correctly record what the accused had said. Secondly, with regard to that part of the s 122(6) statement, which said: `I did not beat or threatened (sic) her`, it is an exculpatory statement, and the learned trial judge appeared to have accepted it presumably on the basis that the accused impressed him as an honest witness. Again, such evidence must be tested against the primary facts and other evidence before the court.
There is one aspect of the evidence of Inspector Deep Singh which corroborates the fact that the accused had misrepresented to AB that he was a policeman. After his arrest, the accused led Inspector Deep Singh to the spot at Changi Coast Road, where he said he pointed to AB the SIA Engineering Building as the building in which the Changi Airport Police Station was located and to which they would be going. The truth of this evidence had never been denied by the accused at any stage of the trial. If the accused had not misrepresented to AB that he was a policeman, it is irrelevant whether that building is where the police station is located and there is no purpose of their going there.
We now turn to another aspect of the evidence of AB and the accused. It was not disputed that AB had handed to the accused her passport and that the accused placed or kept it on the front dashboard on his side. The material question is when did this take place and the circumstances in which the passport was handed to the accused. AB`s evidence was that at the first encounter the accused said he was a police officer and demanded the passport and she handed it to him. The accused`s evidence, on the other hand, was that during the journey while they were travelling along East Coast Parkway, in the course of their conversation pertaining to AB making trips to and from India, AB on her own volition produced the passport and showed it to him; he looked at it and then placed it in front of the dashboard. If those were the circumstances in which the passport was produced the natural thing for him to do would be to return the passport to AB. There is no reason why AB in the midst of that conversation should on her own volition show him her passport and there is equally no reason why he should keep her passport. We again find the accused`s evidence difficult to accept and that AB`s evidence was more consistent with the uncontroverted facts and the other material evidence.
With great respect to the learned trial judge, on the whole we find AB`s evidence much closer to the truth. Our conclusion is that the accused at the first encounter must have told her that he was a policeman or an officer authorized to inspect her passport and must have demanded the production of her passport and that was the time when she handed her passport to him. Secondly, he must have ordered her to board the van on the pretext that he was a police officer and that he was bringing her in for further investigation, and in consequence she was compelled to do so by reason of the apparent authority held out by him.
We find that the accused had practised deception on her and had thereby induced her to board the van and travel with him which she otherwise would not have done so. That clearly was an act of abduction falling within the meaning of s 362 of the Penal Code, which defines abduction as follows: 
 
Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces any person to go from any place, is said to abduct that person.
 
 
 
The accused had by deceitful means induced AB to board the van and brought her all the way to a spot off Changi Coast Road, to which she otherwise would not have gone.
The facts here pertaining to abduction are somewhat similar to those in . There, a young woman who had been kidnapped managed to escape and was on her way to the police station when she met the accused. The latter enquired who she was and where she was going and on hearing that she had been kidnapped and had escaped, persuaded her to go home with him saying that he was a policeman and would escort her to the 
 thana 
. He took her to his house and locked her there. He then took an earring from her and with that he went to see her mother and promised to return the girl on payment of a sum of money. It was held that the accused was guilty of abduction under s 365 of the Indian Penal Code. Broadway J said at p 160: 
 
Now when the appellant met the girl she had ceased to be a kidnapped woman in the strict sense. She was then a free agent but she would not have gone with the appellant but for his false representations to her as to his being a police constable and the inducement held out by him that he would take her to the police station. His action therefore amounted to abduction as defined in s 362 IPC.
 
 
 
Next, the accused said in his evidence that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. He abducted her with the intent that she might be compelled or be forced to having illicit intercourse with him. In our opinion, on the evidence adduced the necessary ingredients of the offence under s 366 of the Penal Code have been established beyond any reasonable doubt. We find him guilty of the first charge.
We now turn to the second main issue: whether AB consented to having sexual intercourse with the accused. We revert once again to the evidence of the accused. His testimony was that he asked AB where she was going to which she replied that she was going to her room, and he then asked whether both of them could go to the room. She said her room was at Veerasamy Road. He thereupon asked her to board the van and she did so willingly. If that was true he would have driven her to her place of abode at Veerasamy Road and would have gone to the room to have sexual intercourse with her. That was what he wanted. That, however, was not what he did. He drove the van past Veerasamy Road and brought AB to a deserted vacant land off Changi Coast Road. Next, it was his evidence that after parking the van, he went and joined her in the rear compartment of the van. He then told AB that that was where they were going to have sexual intercourse and he asked her to undress. AB willingly undressed herself and to all intents and purposes was ready and willing to have sexual intercourse with him. Indeed, AB even went further: at his mere request she willingly performed the fellatio before they had sexual intercourse. Such evidence struck us as inherently incredible. It is inconceivable that AB, a mature woman of 44 years old - that was what the learned trial judge has found - would willingly participate in such sexual activities with a man such as the accused, a total stranger, in those circumstances. Even if AB was a prostitute or a woman of loose morals, there was no reason why she would do what she did without some prior discussion or negotiation as to her reward for such services. On that aspect there was not a shred of evidence coming from him. Nor was it his evidence that during the half an hour journey from Hampshire Road to Changi Coast Road he had succeeded in charming AB, so much so that when they arrived at Changi Coast Road she had become so close and warm towards him that she was prepared at his request or on his persuasion first to perform the fellatio and thereafter to have the sexual intercourse with him. To our mind, on the evidence before us, there was no reason why she would be so willing to engage in such sexual activities with him in the rear compartment of a van, which was stuffy, warm and uncomfortable, on an isolated spot off Changi Coast Road, in broad daylight at about 12 noon. The irresistible inference is that AB was forced to submit to these outrageous indignities at his hands out of fear. True it is that there was not a single scratch on either the accused or AB, and there was no weapon used. True also that there was no struggle or physical resistance on the part of AB. However, we need hardly say that the absence of injury on the victim of a rape, though a relevant consideration, is not fatal to the charge of rape. Authorities are in abundance on this point. We need to quote only two. In at p 2169 the High Court of Orissa said, at p 2169: 
 
10 In a case of rape, consent, if any, given by the victim must be voluntary. A mere act of helpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, quiescence, non-resistance, or passive giving in, when volitional faculty is either clouded by fear or vitiated by duress, cannot be deemed to be `consent`. ... But as has been observed in the case of (1980) 4 SCC 262 [1980 Cri LJ 1344], the absence of injuries on the person of the victim girl may not be fatal to the prosecution and corroborative evidence may not be an imperative component of judicial credence in rape cases.
 
 
 
In at p 162, Coomaraswamy J said: 
 
It was argued that the absence of injury tended to show consent. That is true where an accused used physical force to get the victim to submit to sexual intercourse. There was no such allegation here. [The victim] was overawed into submission by the conduct of Teo, Sim and Ng, by the whereabouts of the events, a deserted quarry on a dark night and by the presence of three men outside the cabin when the fourth was alone with her. ...
 
 
 
On the evidence before us, it is not difficult to come to the conclusion that AB was overawed into submission by the conduct of the accused and the whereabouts of the crime. AB was brought to an isolated spot and was alone with the accused inside the rear compartment of the van. She was completely in his hands and was helpless. She could not possibly engage in an unarmed combat with the accused. She must have participated in all those sexual acts out of fear of the accused. The learned trial judge found AB a mature woman of 44 years old and that she is tall and heavy - a physique which the accused said appealed to him. That may be so. But the accused is no midget either. On the contrary, he too is tall and heavy (if not taller and heavier than AB), and from what we observe he is a burly young man of 27 years old with a very strong physique.
Evidence of AB`s conduct subsequent to the event was wholly consistent with and supported her evidence that she had been raped. Simon Tay`s evidence was that when he stopped his car to answer her call for help he found her to be `distressed and emotional` and that she kept uttering `police`. His wife, Siow Jin Hua, confirmed in substance what he said. Abdul Karim bin Senin, the first police officer AB saw, found her crying and he was unable to gather sufficient facts from her due to her emotional state. S/Sgt A R Rajagopal, who interviewed her over the telephone soon after she was brought to the police station, found her emotional and crying and managed to find out from her that she had been raped and robbed of a sum of $6000. ASP Teo, who interviewed her later, gathered that she had been raped and robbed and that she was very emotional and was sobbing during the interview.
Then there was the evidence of Dr Lai Sing Foo who examined AB some seven hours later and found her still crying during the questioning when she informed him that she had been raped and robbed. AB was apparently still in the state of anguish and distress.
If the evidence of AB is tested against all this evidence and the evidence of deception practised on her by the accused that he was a police officer and also against the incredible evidence of the accused, the conclusion is irresistible that she had been raped by the accused and had been put in fear of the accused.
The learned trial judge found it somewhat inexplicable that AB did not take the opportunity to escape when the van stopped at two or three times on the way to East Coast Parkway. With respect, we do not share that view. The explanation clearly is that until she was brought to the deserted vacant land, she was still under the impression that the accused was a police officer who had detained her passport and was bringing her in for questioning. There was therefore no reason for her to run away from a law enforcer. Indeed, on the basis of that belief to do so would be most inadvisable.
The learned trial judge`s acceptance of the accused`s evidence was based mainly on his impression of AB and the accused and the manner in which AB and the accused gave evidence. These factors are of course important and play a vital role in the determination of the veracity and credibility of their evidence. However, it is equally important to test their evidence against some objective facts and independent evidence. In at p 878 Yong Pung How CJ delivering the judgment of this court said: 
 
As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 88
  at p 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence.
 
 
 
It is also helpful to remind ourselves of what Ong Hock Thye FJ said in , at p 223: 
 
To avoid undue emphasis on demeanour, it may be well to remember what was said by Lord Wright, and often quoted, from his judgment in 
[1935] AC 243
, at p 267 of the possibility of judges being deceived by adroit or plausible knaves or by apparent innocence.
 
 
 
We now turn to the third main issue which relates to the charge of robbery. Here, we need only to revert to the evidence of the accused on how he took the money. He said that after the sexual intercourse with AB, while the latter was dressing, he noticed there was a knot tied to the saree. He had a look at it and found money in it. He took the money and put it in his pocket. AB attempted to snatch it back and in that attempt she ripped off part of his pocket and fell in a sitting position on the floorboard of the van. On that evidence, what he did was more than theft simpliciter; it was robbery. Robbery as defined in s 390(2) is as follows: 
 
Theft is `robbery` if, in order to commit theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death, or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. ...
 
 
 
Purely on his evidence the ingredients of the offence of robbery have been established. Certain degree of force must have been used by him on her to restrain her from getting back her money, which accounted for the ripping off of his pocket and her fall onto the floorboard. She did not persist in making a further attempt to get back her money and the reason was obviously that she was in fear of him. Bearing in mind that first he had forced her to submit to the sexual indignities and secondly he took her money by force the irresistible inference is that he must have caused her fear of further hurt to herself when he took her money. In our judgment, what the accused did in the circumstances amounted to robbery. We find him guilty of the charge.
In the result, we allow the appeal and set aside the order made by the learned trial judge on the charges of abduction, rape and robbery. We convict the accused of the first charge of abduction under s 366, the third charge of rape under s 376(2)(b) and the fourth charge of robbery under s 392.

This was an appeal from a decision of the district judge convicting the appellant on seven charges of illegal moneylending contrary to s 8(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) (the Act) and four charges of harassment contrary to s 33(1).
Section 8(1)(b) reads: 
 
If any person ... carries on a business as a moneylender without holding a licence ... he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 and for a second or subsequent offence to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both ... .
 
 
 
And s 33(1) reads: 
 
Any moneylender who, personally, or by any person acting on his behalf, harasses or intimidates his debtor, any member of the debtor`s family or any other person in connection with the loan to the debtor at, or watches or besets, the residence or place of business or employment of the debtor, the member of the debtor`s family or that other person, or any place at which the debtor receives his wages or any other sum periodically due to him, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both ... .
 
 
 
A total fine of $123,000 was imposed.
After hearing the appeal, this court amended the four charges of harassment to charges of intimidation. The appeal was then dismissed save for one of the charges of intimidation. The reasons are now given.
 The prosecution`s case below 
It was alleged that the appellant had lent money illegally to Chong Chew Hua (Chong) and Ling Ing Hoi (Ling) separately on various occasions in 1994. After both Chong and Ling had failed to pay off the amounts outstanding, the appellant had harassed Goh Keng Leong (Goh), Chong`s husband, and Khoo Lea Heng (Khoo), Ling`s wife.
 Chong 
Chong was an operator of a gambling den in Lorong Ah Soo with Ling and several others. In early October 1994, she borrowed $2,000 from the appellant, which was to be paid through daily payments of $120 for 20 to 30 days. However, after making payments for just about a week, Chong, who was by this time operating a den at Bedok, borrowed another $3,000, which was to be repaid by daily sums of $180 for 20 days. Another loan of $3,000 was again taken in a week`s time, on the same terms and without repayment of the earlier loan; on this occasion Chong was at Tampines. Finally, after another week`s payments, a fourth loan of $2,000 was taken with repayment of $120 per day for 20 days. At this point, Chong was operating a den in Balestier. No payment was ever made on this loan. None of the loans made were documented.
At the end of November, Chong`s husband, Goh, said that he was paged by the appellant, who identified himself as `Ah Long`. Goh was told that his wife had failed to repay a loan of $10,000. When the appellant was informed that Chong was missing, he told Goh that the latter ought to repay the money owed. In addition, the appellant also instructed him to locate Chong. In the course of the conversation, vulgarities were used against Goh. The appellant also accused Chong of committing robbery by failing to pay the loan.
Subsequently in February 1995, while Goh was outside his flat praying, the appellant, accompanied by another person, approached Goh and identified himself as `Ah Long`. The appellant asked for the wife. Even though she was actually in the house sleeping, Goh told the appellant that Chong was not at home. Upon hearing this, the appellant instructed Goh to inform Chong to contact the appellant within three days. No threats were made on this occasion.
 Ling 
As regards Ling, the prosecution`s case was that, while he was operating a Hougang gambling den in July 1994, he had borrowed $8,000 from the appellant. Of the total principal, $3,000 was to be paid back through daily payments of $60 running until the portion was repaid, while the remaining $5,000 was to be paid by daily payments of $300 for 20 days.
After completing payments for the first loan, Ling took out another loan of $15,000. In this instance, $5,000 was to be repaid over 20 days with daily payments of $300. As for the balance of $10,000, daily interest of $200 was levied until the principal sum was repaid. Payment of the $5,000 portion was completed; the interest on the $10,000 tranche was paid for a month, but the principal sum was never repaid.
In late October 1994, Ling borrowed a further $20,000. Again the amount was separated into one tranche of $5,000 and another of $15,000. Payment for the first tranche was through daily instalments of $300 for 20 days, while for the latter tranche daily interest of $300 was charged up to the repayment of the principal. For eight to nine days, Ling paid the interest on the $5,000 but eventually stopped. No interest was paid on the $15,0000. Ling went into hiding in Johore. In none of the loans were documents signed.
In November, Khoo, Ling`s wife, was visited in the early morning by someone calling himself `Ah Long`, later identified as the appellant, and at least one other person. That person got Khoo to page for Ling, who was told that there was someone looking for him. The appellant tried to speak to Ling directly, but Khoo refused him entry.
In December, the appellant, again accompanied, visited Khoo one evening. This time they spoke through the door grilles. Khoo refused to page for Ling as requested by the appellant. The appellant informed her that Ling was indebted to him, and that, if Ling failed to pay, the debt would, in his words, remain forever. Khoo did not understand what was meant by that remark, but was scared.
 The arrest 
In January 1995, Chong returned home to find, on the landing walls graffiti in Chinese which carried her address and a demand for repayment. She made a police report. On 8 February, a meeting was arranged by Chong, at the suggestion of the police, with the appellant, at a fast food outlet at Cathay Building. When the appellant met her, he was arrested by police officers.
Upon investigation, it was found that the appellant was not a licensed moneylender.
 The defence 
The appellant in his defence stated that he was indeed owed $10,000 by Chong and $15,000 by Ling, but in both cases the amounts owed were gambling debts. In his version of events, the appellant said that in October 1994, he had gambled with Chong and Ling at the den in Balestier. Chong and Ling lost to him. At first they had paid up their debts during the course of the game, but subsequently they told him that they would have to pay him at the end of the gambling session. When it came to that point though, they further postponed repayment to the next day. The appellant understood by this that payment was to be effected at the den, although no time was specified. While normally the appellant would not have allowed others to owe him debts incurred in gambling, he thought that Chong and Ling were reliable as they were den operators. The appellant alleged that no interest was to be charged on either of the amounts.
The next day though, Chong and Ling did not turn up. The appellant tried paging Ling but got no response. In February 1995, the appellant eventually managed to get Chong`s address. Late one night in that month, at about 11pm, he went to the address alone, but only found Goh, who told him that Chong was not around. Goh was asked to contact Chong, but no such attempt was made. As no useful response could be elicited from Goh, the appellant left. The appellant claimed that no obscenities were used then.
The next day, Chong had contacted him, and arranged the meeting at which the appellant was arrested. The appellant denied approaching Ling or his family concerning the $15,000 owed to him.
In several statements made to the police, the appellant denied being an illegal moneylender and harassing anyone. In all of the statements he stated that he had been merely trying to collect gambling debts.
The appellant further explained in his defence in court that he had investments in Taiwan. On several occasions in August, September and October 1994, the appellant was abroad in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
One Tan Bee Kin (Tan) testified for the defence. She had been employed as a worker in the gambling den, and had seen the appellant, whom she had known for about nine years, gambling there. During the last occasion when she saw the appellant together with Chong and Ling, she had ceased to work and was in fact only delivering something. She said that the appellant was there occasionally. At no time did she ever see the appellant giving loans. Her testimony was that she had heard Ling saying that he owed the appellant $1,000. Her testimony was largely the same in regard to Chong.
Another witness for the defence was Lim Lai Wah (Lim), who was a gambler and had known the appellant for about seven years. She said that the appellant was an occasional gambler. According to her, the appellant gambled with a group including her as well as Chong and Ling. During this session, the two lost heavily, and eventually told the appellant that they would pay him the next day.
 Decision below 
The judge considered that the appellant`s version did not raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution`s case. In coming to his decision, the judge was of the opinion that both Chong`s and Ling`s evidence had to be scrutinized carefully and was conscious that both of them had been engaged in illegal activities. Nonetheless, he found that their version was credible. He considered that these witnesses could have given less elaborate versions if they had merely wanted to fabricate something.
The judge also noted that counsel for the appellant had not put the appellant`s version, namely, that the debts were gambling losses wagered during a single sitting, to either Chong or Ling. Neither was it put to Ling that the appellant was owed only $15,000 instead of $43,000.
As for the evidence of the two defence witnesses, Tan and Lim, this was considered suspect, particularly since the two were friends of the appellant. The judge noted an inconsistency in the evidence of Lim, who had said that Chong and Ling had arranged payment the next day in the course of the game, even though the appellant himself had stated that the two had only made that arrangement at the end of the game. A similar difficulty was highlighted by the judge as regards the evidence of Tan.
Further, it was considered strange that the two debtors could pay off losses due to others but not to the appellant, and that the appellant was so ready to postpone payment, without adequate safeguards. Finally, as regards the harassment, the judge found the evidence of the prosecution witnesses credible and true.
The judge therefore convicted the appellant on all 11 charges. In sentencing the appellant, it was observed that there were no relevant antecedents. The appellant`s declining to put forward anything in mitigation was also noted. It was considered that a deterrent sentence depriving the appellant of his ill-gotten gains had to be imposed. In the event a total of $123,000 in fines was imposed.
 The appeal 
The appellant`s case on appeal
It was argued that the evidence of Chong and Ling had to be treated with caution and that the judge ought to have directed his mind to the danger of convicting on their uncorroborated evidence as the two witnesses had purposes of their own to serve.
It was also argued that the fact that the two witnesses were able to give the detailed mechanics of repayment, and that Ling had described an elaborate division of loans into separate tranches was not conclusive, given that the two were engaged in illegal activities themselves. Too much emphasis was placed as well by the judge on the acquaintanceship of the defence witnesses and the appellant. The inconsistencies found by the judge in the evidence of the defence witnesses were not material or significant. It was also argued that there was nothing strange in the appellant allowing Chong and Ling to owe him money. The evidence of Goh and Khoo was also suspect as there could have been collusion between them and their respective spouses. The appellant`s visit at Chong`s home, which on his evidence was at 11pm, was not harassment simply because of the time of the visit.
The appellant pointed to the fact that Chong and Ling were gambling operators and that there were no supporting documents to indicate that his defence ought to be accepted. Also, the prosecution ought to have called as witnesses other gamblers at the dens who were present during the supposed visits by the appellant to collect money; as these were not called, a presumption that their evidence would be unfavourable to the prosecution operated. Further, the appellant argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive as the fines would be crushing, while the offences committed were not of the most serious sort.
The prosecution case
The prosecution`s arguments were directed primarily towards reiterating the findings made by the trial judge. It was also argued that the sentences were not manifestly excessive in light of various precedents.
 The issues 
The following issues arose:
 
 
(1) The evaluation of the evidence 
 
(2) Sentencing
  
 
 
No argument had been taken that the appellant was not engaged in the business of moneylending.
 The evaluation of the evidence 
The basis of the discussion of this issue will be the contentions raised by the appellant in his petition. These may be grouped as follows:
 
 
(i) the effect of the evidence of a person with an interest to serve; 
 
(ii) the acceptance by the judge of the evidence of Chong and Ling, and the rejection of that of the appellant, and his witnesses Lim and Tan; 
 
(iii) whether the appellant`s first visit to Chong`s flat amounted to harassment; and 
 
(iv) the failure of the prosecution to produce certain witnesses.
  
 
 
 
 
 The evidence of a person with an interest to serve 
 
 
 
It was argued that the judge ought to have noted that Chong and Ling had their own interests to serve in giving evidence against the appellant, that is, to avoid repayment of the supposed gambling debts. He ought then, it was said, to have looked for corroboration or be cautious in accepting that evidence. The judge`s finding that the evidence of Lim and Tan was suspect was also attacked. To determine these issues, it was necessary first to examine what approach ought to be taken as regards the evidence of persons with interests to serve.
A number of local cases have identified situations in which some caution or even corroboration is required when the witnesses concerned have interests of their own to serve. One of these is 
 Teo Thin Chan & Anor v PP 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 184
 , in which it was held that the evidence of the mother of the complainant ought not be accepted without supporting evidence. In 
 Tan Kheng Ann & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 108
 , fellow prisoners of the accused, who were charged with murder, gave evidence. The direction to the jury contained the warning that conviction upon that evidence would be dangerous unless its truth was absolutely convicting. The Federal Court, on appeal from Singapore, upheld that direction. Subsequently, Raja Azlan Shah in 
 Lim Boon San v PP 
 
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 45
  said that as regards a witness with a purpose of his own to serve, the judge would have to be wary of convicting on uncorroborated evidence. In 
Ng Kum Peng v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 231
  this issue was noted but not gone into.
Most of the cases were decided before the amendments removing the need for corroboration of accomplice evidence were passed. This is an important consideration since the approach in these cases mirrored that for accomplice evidence.
Some guidance may be obtained from the law on accomplice evidence. The person with an interest to serve is in many ways akin to an accomplice - the latter too has his own interest to protect, that is, the lessening of his involvement in the crime. In relation to accomplice evidence, s 135 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) states: 
 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 
 
 
Section 116 reads: 
 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 
 
Illustrations
 
 
 
The Court may presume -
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution; 
 
...
  
 
 
There is thus no requirement at present for any corroboration warning, but the evidence of an accomplice may, and indeed, generally would, be treated with caution. In light of the removal of the corroboration warning for accomplice evidence, it is not necessary either for the judge to administer himself a similar warning as regards the evidence of a person with an interest to serve, in contrast to the present position as to the evidence of victims of sexual offences and children.
It is open for the judge to so treat the evidence of an interested person with caution, but this is not a general rule. Whether caution is in fact required is very much dependent on the facts of the case. No purpose would be served by the laying down of a rigid rule. Witnesses such as relatives, or persons in an antagonistic relationship with the accused, do not necessarily attract the same caution. The purpose to be served by giving unreliable evidence has to be shown to be particularly strong before such a witness can be regarded as tainted. It is for the trial judge, upon considering the circumstances of the case, to decide whether a particular witness warrants that additional care.
So long as it is apparent that the trial judge has not accepted the evidence of witnesses akin to accomplices wholesale without scrutiny, an appellate court would be slow to interfere with his findings of fact, or his preference for one witness`s testimony over that of another.
 The evidence of Chong and Ling 
Turning now to the specific contention of the appellant, it was said that the trial judge had erred in not considering that the debtors had purposes of their own to serve. In support he cited 
 Lim Boon San v PP 
.
The judge noted that the debtors were not without blemish. He indicated therefore that he knew that the evidence of these witnesses could not be accepted without scrutiny. In any event, the circumstances of this appeal do not justify such caution as argued for by the appellant. Contrary to his contention, the avoidance of a payment of money is not such a strong motive for giving contrary evidence. Indeed, the assault alleged in 
 Ng Kum Peng 
 which the appellant sought to distinguish, would be a stronger reason for giving false evidence than the mere avoidance of payment of money. An allegation of non-payment of a wager could be easily made by any illegal moneylender.
 Acquaintanceship of Lim, Tan and the appellant 
There is no rule of law that acquaintanceship with a party to a proceeding always attracts the need for caution. The judge in giving weight to the length of their acquaintanceship must have taken that into consideration alongside the other observations he would have been able to make about their credit and veracity. It would be wrong to say that the judge had in fact decided to apply anything similar to the principle in 
 Lim Boon San 
; he was merely exercising his judgement based on a number of observations, one of which would have been the length of their acquaintanceship. He did not place undue weight on it.
Furthermore, the judge did not reject the evidence of Tan and Lim simply because they were acquaintances of the appellant - he noted that there were some incongruities in the evidence given by the two, which pointed to what was described by the judge as a taint in favour of the appellant. These will be examined in the following section.
 Preference for the prosecution evidence 
The judge preferred the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. He found that their evidence was `forthright, did not appear fabricated and [the witnesses] gave details of the various transactions involved,`. He noted that Ling had testified that the sums he had borrowed were in two tranches, with different interest and repayment rates. The judge thought that this was all too elaborate for it to be a fabrication. With respect, this is not a forceful consideration - it is conceivable that Ling would have had some experience of other illegal loans, and would have known about the loan terms of illegal moneylenders.
The judge also considered it material that the appellant`s case was not put to either Chong or Ling. This pertained to the fact that the debts were in fact gambling debts incurred at one sitting, and that the loan to Ling was not $43,000, the total of the three charges involving Ling, but only $15,000. While the failure to put a case may imply the acceptance of the opposing case (
 R v Fenlon 
 (1980) 71 Cr App R 307), it must be noted that this is not the invariable consequence. In any event, the appellant`s counsel did put the case that the debts were incurred in gambling. In relation to Chong, the cross-examination was as follows: 
 
Q: Likewise when the [appellant] won his bets when he was the banker you did not pay him but said that you would owe him the money?
A: No.
 
 
 
As for Ling: 
 
Q: When you lost the bet with the accused, you told him that you owed him the money?
 
 
 
 
A: No. I did not gamble with him. 
 
Q: Likewise when the [appellant] played banker and you lost you did not pay the [appellant] but told him that you owed him the money? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At the end of this gambling session you owed the [appellant] $15,000? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Put: That you promised to repay the [appellant] the next day? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
Based on the above, the appellant`s case was adequately, though barely, put to the prosecution witnesses.
Nonetheless, the judge was entitled to find that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was credible and ought to be preferred - he had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, and make his own assessment of their credibility and credit.
There was some evidence of the appellant being abroad during the period of the alleged offences. This would have put into doubt the statement of the debtors that they had been able to make daily payments everyday during the period that the appellant was away. However, this did not adversely affect the prosecution evidence for the witnesses had only given approximate dates of the taking out of the loans and repayment so it was still possible for those payments to have been made.
The two witnesses for the defence will next be dealt with. A couple of incongruities were noted by the judge. The first incongruity related to the point of time when Chong and Ling had supposedly arranged for repayment the day after the game - the appellant`s case was that this was only done at the end, but his witness, Lim, who had supposedly left before then, appeared to have testified to have personal knowledge of that. The other inconsistency was of a similar nature. Tan had testified that she had left the den before the game had ended, which the judge considered odd since she was supposedly a worker there. The explanation given by Tan that she had stopped working for the operators by then, and that she was only delivering something, appeared to the judge to be an afterthought.
As regards Tan, her testimony need not be interpreted in the manner of the judge. In cross-examination, she had testified as follows: 
 
Q: Did you know how much [Chong] and [Ling] owed the [appellant] after the last gambling session?
 
 
 
 
A: I do not know. 
 
Q: You were there until the den closed? 
 
A: No. I left home before the session ended. 
 
Q: The following day did you go back to work? 
 
A: In fact when I went to Balestier on that occasion I no longer worked for them. The purpose of visit on that occasion was to send a refrigerator to them at the gambling den.
  
 
 
Her explanation then was not so much an explanation of her leaving early, but of the fact that she had not gone back the next day. If so, this was not an afterthought on her part.
The evidence of Lim was however indeed suspect. She had testified: 
 
This session started in early afternoon and I left at about 9pm to 10pm. The session was still going on. The [appellant, Chong and Ling] were still there.
 
 
 
...
In the course of the game they lost very heavy. They used rubber and told the [appellant] that they would pay him tomorrow.
But the appellant had testified: 
 
In October 1994, we gambled for about four to five hours. At the end of the gambling session, [Chong] owed me $10,000. [Ling] owed me $15,000. At first during the game, [Chong and Ling] told me that they would pay me at the end of the game but at the end of the game they told me they did not have funds and asked me to allow them to pay the next day.
 
 
 
There was thus a direct contradiction between Lim`s and the appellant`s evidence. In view of this, both testimonies were suspect, and, on this basis alone, the judge would have been entitled to reject their evidence.
As for the appellant himself, the judge found that his evidence was fabricated. The judge was led to this conclusion as he found it odd that Chong and Ling could pay up to the others but not the appellant; furthermore, the appellant hardly knew the debtors and got no acknowledgement or particulars from them; and the arrangements for repayment appeared all too uncertain. Of the three reasons identified, the latter two would appear to have some force. The appellant said that he considered the two debtors to be in a different category from most other debtors, but, notwithstanding that, it was still suspicious that all the arrangements were so scanty and uncertain. The appellant`s evidence was not convincing, and did not raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case.
However, as regards the finding that it was odd that Chong and Ling could pay off other players but not the appellant, there was not much weight that could be attached to this - the evidence was that the appellant wagered large amounts, and it was conceivable that the other players would not have wagered, and therefore won, similar large amounts. If so, it was possible that Chong and Ling would have been able to pay off the others. Lim had testified that the average bet was $500, with the least being about $100.
The conclusion was, therefore, that the judge was justified in coming to the conclusion that the evidence of Chong and Ling was to be preferred to that of the appellant, Tan and Lim.
Turning to the evidence of Goh and Khoo, these witnesses were adamant that they had been visited on two occasions each by the appellant, or at least a person who identified himself as `Ah Long`, which name was testified to have been used on at least one occasion by the appellant before both Goh and Khoo. The judge was entitled to prefer their evidence to that of the appellant.
 Whether the visit to Goh`s flat was harassment 
The appellant contended that the judge was wrong in finding that a visit at 11pm constituted harassment. The judge had noted: 
 
In any case the time of the visit, be it 11pm or 1am, clearly implied an intention to harass [Chong] and those living at her flat.
 
 
 
There is no definition of `harassment` in the Moneylender`s Act. Neither is there any judicial definition of the term. 
 The New Shorter Oxford 
 defines the verb `harass` as: 
 
Trouble by repeated attacks. Now freq, subject to constant molesting or persecution.
 
 
 
There is a necessary quality of repetition or persistency. The notion of harassment has to be contrasted with that of intimidation - the latter undoubtedly could include an isolated act; the juxtaposition implies therefore that the normal use of the term harassment has to be preserved. This interpretation is consistent with the decision of this court in 
PP v Tan Poh Heng
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 518
  , in which the appellant had visited the home of the debtor, and subsequently made a number of telephone calls. There was an attempt to persuade this court that a single visit could not amount to harassment. But it was found that that visit could not be isolated from a series of phone calls. It was stated at p 520: 
 
Both the visit and the telephone calls were part of a threatening course of conduct which had as its aim the demand for repayment of the debt due from the complainant`s husband and which caused alarm and distress to the complainant. In the circumstances I did not see how it could sensibly be said that there was doubt as to whether the respondent had `harassed` the complainant.
 
 
 
It must be noted that a single visit or encounter could undoubtedly amount to harassment if its intensity amounts to a persistent attack or persecution. Thus, if a loan shark were to make a single visit to a recalcitrant debtor, and remained at his door for several hours, that could amount to harassment. On the other hand, it is doubtful that a single visit of a short duration, albeit at a late hour, is sufficient to amount to harassment.
However, it could amount to an implied form of intimidation, which is the other act caught by s 33 of the Moneylenders Act. On the facts, in relation to Goh, the evidence is that there was use of vulgar language during the first visit to his flat, which would support the conclusion that there was some form of intimidation. Though the charge was one of harassment, an amendment to one of intimidation would not have caused any prejudice.
The second visit to Goh, on the other hand, did not disclose anything that would support a finding of either harassment or intimidation. It must be noted that the sixth charge against the appellant, which dealt with the second visit, stated that harassment was committed in that Goh was told to get Chong to pay up, otherwise Goh would have to settle the debt himself. This could fall within the ambit of acts of intimidation, but it would seem that that charge is not supported on the facts at all. Goh said in his examination-in-chief: 
 
On 8 February 1995 at about 1.30am, I was praying outside my unit. The [appellant] came up to my unit with another male Chinese. He identified himself as `Ah Long`. The [appellant] asked me about the whereabouts of my wife. My wife was sleeping in the flat. I was in the midst of praying and did not like being interrupted. I told the [appellant] that my wife was not at home. They told me to relay the message to my wife asking her to contact the [appellant] within three days. That was all he said. The [appellant] did not warn of any consequences if the money was not paid.
 
 
 
In fact, it was during the first visit that Goh was told to settle for his wife. Nothing in the evidence given by Goh would support the facts alleged in the charge.
An act of harassment could be made out if the second visit was taken together with the graffiti drawn at the landing, but no evidence was apparently adduced of the latter, save that Chong had come across it sometime in January 1995. In fact there was no evidence before the court that the graffiti on that occasion was caused by the appellant. Neither was it linked to him. The sixth charge was, therefore, not proven against the appellant.
As for the visits to Khoo, while neither of them constituted harassment, taken individually, they were sufficient acts of intimidation. The first visit to Khoo took place at 1am, with the appellant shouting loudly. A visit at such a time can only be taken generally to be calculated to intimidate the debtor or his family. Similarly, the cryptic remark of the appellant during the second visit, that if the debt was not repaid it would remain forever, would also in the circumstances have to be construed as calculated to intimidate as well. Again, no prejudice would have occurred if the charges were amended.
Following the recent Court of Appeal decision in 
Garmaz s/o Parkhar v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
  , it was open to this court to substitute under s 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code a conviction of intimidation for one of harassment. This was accordingly ordered to the 5th, 6th, 10th and 11th charges. The sixth charge, however, was not proven on the facts.
 Failure to call witnesses 
Counsel for the appellant raised a point that the prosecution did not call as witnesses other gamblers who were present to support their case that the appellant had visited Chong at least at the dens to get repayment of the various loans. He relied on s 116, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act which reads: 
 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 
 
Illustrations
 
 
 
The court may presume -
 
 
 
(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.
 
 
 
The appellant`s contention was that the failure of the prosecution to adduce the evidence of those other gamblers meant that the court could presume that the evidence would have gone against the prosecution, that is that there were no such visits.
Such arguments are commonly made. Commonly too, such arguments are without merit. The court must hesitate to draw any such presumption unless the witness not produced is essential to the prosecution`s case. Any criminal transaction may be observed by a number of witnesses. It is not necessary for the prosecution to produce every single one of those witnesses. All the prosecution need do is to produce witnesses whose evidence can be believed so as to establish the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Out of a number of witnesses, it may then only be necessary to bring in one or two; as long as those witnesses actually produced are able to give evidence of the transaction, there is no reason why all of the rest should be called, nor why any presumption should be drawn that the evidence of those witnesses not produced would have been against the prosecution. Where the witnesses not produced are not material, no presumption operates against the prosecution (
 Lahvinder Singh v State 
 [1988] Cri LJ 319). Neither would s 116 illustration (g) apply where the evidence to be given is largely redundant (
 Waisuddin v State 
[1991] Cri LJ 134). It was not shown that, in this appeal, the evidence of the witnesses not called was not immaterial or redundant.
It must be emphasized that s 116 illustration (g) is not mandatory. That provision merely states that the court may draw a presumption, not that it must. In determining whether or not that presumption ought to be drawn the court will have regard to all the circumstances, but particularly and importantly the materiality of the witnesses not produced. The adoption of any other approach would be to encourage the adducing of unnecessary evidence, prolonging the trial and confusing the issues.
The question that arises here is distinct from the question of whether the prosecution exercised its discretion correctly in not calling various witnesses for the prosecution. The latter was not raised in this appeal, but in view of the constant confusion between the two, it is necessary to deal with this point briefly. A number of English, Australian and Malaysian authorities have dealt with the duty of the prosecution to call witnesses. It has been thought that the failure to call witnesses may in some circumstances amount to a miscarriage of justice. This is a question of procedural fairness and justice. It has no evidentiary effect. The presumption under s 116 is evidentiary in nature - a set of facts is taken to be true upon the failure to produce a particular witness. Thus, while both the presumption and the prosecution`s duty are concerned with the same situation, the non-production of a witness, they are separate consequences. A miscarriage of justice may arise in a situation in which no presumption can be drawn; a presumption may be drawn in a situation that does not qualify as a miscarriage of justice.
The Court of Appeal in 
Lim Young Sien v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
  , in discussing s 116(g) had the opportunity to give its view on the duty of the prosecution. It was said at p 266: 
 
In our judgment, the law is well settled that, in a criminal case, the prosecution has a discretion whether or not to call a particular witness, provided that there is no ulterior motive, and the witness, who is available to, but not called by, the prosecution, is offered to the defence.
 
 
 
The discretion conferred upon the prosecution cannot be fettered by any obligation to call a particular witness. What the prosecution has to do is to prove its case. It is not obliged to go out of its way to allow the defence any opportunity to test its evidence. It is not obliged to act for the defence. Only if there is an intention to hinder or hamper the defence would the possibility of a miscarriage of justice arise, requiring interference by the courts.
 Sentence 
Section 8(1)(b) has been reproduced above. The judge fined the appellant $12,000 on each of the loans made to Chong and between $15,000 and $20,000 on the loans made to Ling. The judge thought that it was necessary to strip the appellant of the gains from the moneylending. In 
 Ng Kum Peng 
, this court stated that it was necessary to protect persons from either threats of assault by illegal moneylenders or the very activity of moneylending. In that case, the trial judge had imposed the then maximum sentence of $5,000 on each of three charges of illegal loans of $3,000. That sentence was not varied on appeal. Taking those fines into account, and the increased limits, the fines imposed in the present case were not manifestly excessive.
As regards the fines imposed for harassment, $5,000 was imposed in each instance. In 
 PP v Tan Poh Heng 
 , the fine was raised from $8,000 to $12,000. In view of that, again the fines imposed were not manifestly excessive and therefore were upheld.
 Conclusion 
The convictions were correct on ten of the charges. Neither were the fines imposed manifestly excessive. The word `intimidate` was substituted for the word `harass` in DAC 4735/95, DAC 4736/95, DAC 4740/95 and DAC 4741/95. The appeal as to conviction and sentence on charges DAC 4731/95 to DAC 4735/95 and DAC 4736/95 to DAC 4741/95 was dismissed, while the appeal as to charge DAC 4736/95 was allowed, and the fine ordered to be returned to the appellant.

This was an appeal by the plaintiffs against the decision of the deputy registrar granting an application by the second defendant under O 18 r 19(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Rules of the Supreme Court and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court that the statement of claim be struck out and the action dismissed as against the second defendant with costs fixed at $6,000 (the order appealed against).
 The facts 
The first plaintiff was the wife of one Ayakanno Marithamuthu (Muthu). The second, third and fourth plaintiffs are the brothers of the first plaintiff. The fifth plaintiff is the mother and the sixth plaintiff, the sister, respectively of the first plaintiff.
On 18 December 1984, the first plaintiff made a report at the Joo Chiat Police Station stating that Muthu who allegedly had left a week ago after telling her that he was going to Genting Highlands had been missing since.
On 27 March 1987, the first, second, third and fourth plaintiffs were charged with the murder of Muthu at the caretaker`s quarters of the Orchard Road Presbyterian Church, Singapore, at about 10pm on 12 December 1984.
On 28 March 1987, the fifth and sixth plaintiffs were charged with abetment in the murder of Muthu.
On 6 June 1987, the plaintiffs were granted a discharge not amounting to acquittal. Upon their discharge, the second, third and fourth plaintiffs were re-arrested and detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67).
In March 1991, the second, third and fourth plaintiffs filed habeas corpus proceedings to challenge the legality of their detention. Pending the hearing of their application, they were released on 21 June 1991. Following their release, they discontinued their habeas corpus proceedings.
On 23 August 1993, the first plaintiff pursuant to leave of court affirmed in an affidavit that Muthu had been missing since 10 December 1984 and had not been heard of since and, accordingly, she believed him to be dead.
The police investigation, the criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs, their subsequent discharge, the detention of the second to the fourth plaintiffs and their habeas corpus proceedings were reported in 
 The Straits Times 
, a daily newspaper published by the first defendant. These publications were:
 
 
(i) 27 March 1987 - a front page report under the heading `Curry Murder Horror` stated that Muthu reported missing by his wife `was said to have been brought to the church premises on the afternoon of 12 December, a Friday, by three men whom he had been out with earlier in the day. That night he was hit on the head with an iron rod in the kitchen of the quarters, chopped up and cooked in a large aluminium cooking pot similar to the type used by Indian restaurants for 
 nasi 
 
 briyani 
.` 
 
(ii) 27 March 1987 - a write-up at p 11 under the heading `
 Diary of a bizarre killing 
` gave a summary of the police investigation that led to the arrest of the plaintiffs. 
 
(iii) 28 March 1987 - a report under the heading `Woman and three brothers [referring to the first to fourth plaintiffs] charged with murder` stated: `They allegedly killed her husband in church grounds.` 
 
(iv) 29 March 1987 - there was a report under the heading `Two [referring to the fifth and sixth plaintiffs] charged with abetting in caretaker`s murder.` 
 
(v) 4 April 1987 - there was a report under the heading 
 `Caretaker`s murder. 
Judge on lawyer`s right to see client`. 
 
(vi) 5 April 1987 - there was a report under the heading `
 Caretaker`s murder 
. Women charged with abetting murder remanded again.`. 
 
(vii) 11 April 1987 - there was a report under the heading `
 Caretaker murder. 
Accused [referring to the first to fourth plaintiffs] remanded another week.` 
 
(viii) 12 April 1987 - there was a report under the heading `Medical care for accused` that the fifth and sixth plaintiffs were remanded for another week. 
 
(ix) 7 June 1987 - there was a report with the heading `Judge frees six charged in curry murder case. Release for lack of proof but they don`t get full acquittal.` In the same issue appeared a write-up under the heading `five months of digging into caretaker`s murder.` It gave a chronology of the investigation, arrest of and the preferring of charges against the plaintiffs. 
 
(x) 10 March 1991 - there was a report under the heading 
 ` 
""Curry murder case"" brothers challenge detention`. Itreported the habeas corpus action taken by the second, third and fourth plaintiffs. 
 
(xi) 22 June 1991 - there was a report on the release of the second, third and fourth plaintiffs under the heading `Three held since 1987 freed. Unconditional release for brothers detained for allegedly killing brother-in-law.` 
 
(xii) 21 July 1991 - there was a report under the heading `Three drop action against government for wrongful detention`.
  
 
 
On 6 May 1995, there appeared in 
 The Straits Times 
 issue an article in the Leisure page on a serial of five crime stories under the heading `Curry murder case to be in new TCS serial`
 . 
The relevant parts of the article (the passage complained of) read: 
 
The sensational curry murder case, which took place in 1984, will soon be dramatized in the second season of a Mandarin serial by the Television Corporation of Singapore. ...
 
 
 
The case, involving the murder of an Indian man and the cooking of his dismembered body parts in curry (see box) will take up the first five episodes of the show. ...
Mr Tsang Ho Man, executive producer of the serial warned that, although all five stories in the new show are based on true cases, viewers should not expect something like 
 Crime Watch 
, which consists of actual re-enactments of past criminal cases.
`We still have to make sure that the true stories are garnished for dramatic effect,` he said.
The `box` referred to in the passage complained of contained a summary of events (the box). Under the heading `The Curry Murder` it read: 
 
The bizarre curry murder took place on 12 December 1984, at the church quarters of Orchard Road Presbyterian Church.
 
 
 
The victim was Mr Ayakanno Marithamuthu, then 37 and a father of three. He was reported missing in December 1984 by his wife, who informed the police that he had told her he was going to the Genting Highlands in Malaysia.
The victim, who was described as a wife-beater, was then a live-in caretaker of the Public Utilities Board holiday chalets in Changi.
Investigations into the murder showed that he was hit on the head with an iron rod in the kitchen of the quarters and chopped up and cooked in a large aluminium cooking pot.
His wife and her three brothers were charged in 1987 with murder. They were later released in the same year because of the lack of proof.
The three brothers were then re-arrested on the same day and detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.
But they were released unconditionally in June 1991 after spending four years in Changi Prison.
On 12 May 1995, the plaintiffs demanded of the defendants an apology for the allegedly defamatory remarks in the passage complained of. The demand was rejected by the defendants.
 The proceedings 
The plaintiffs then commenced proceedings against the defendants seeking damages for libel arising from the passage complained of read with the box and reports and write-ups enumerated herein. On being served with the writ endorsed with the statement of claim, the second defendant applied for and obtained the order appealed against. The plaintiffs appealed. The appeal came before me. I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
Order 18 r 19(1)(a) reads: 
 
(1) The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that -
 
 
 
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.
 
 
 
On the exercise by the court of its powers to strike out a statement of claim or defence under O 18 r 19, LP Thean J (as he then was) in 
 Bank of China v Asiaweek Ltd 
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 505
  at p 507 stated: 
 
Striking out the whole of a defence to a claim for libel is an extraordinary step and is only allowed in a plain and obvious case. In 
 Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association & Ors
, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for libel in respect of an article published in the 
 British Medical Journal
. The defendants applied to strike out the statement of claim. The application was dismissed by the master and, on appeal, by Milmo J. On further appeal, the Court of Appeal, by a majority, dismissed it. Lord Pearson after referring to O 18 r 19 of the English Rules of Supreme Court said, at pp 695-696:
 
 
 
`Over a long period of years it has been firmly established by many authorities that the powers to strike out a statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action is a summary power which should be exercised only in plain and obvious cases. The authorities are collected in 
 The Supreme Court Practice 1970,
 under the heading `Exercise of powers under this rule` in the notes under RSC O 18 r 19 p 284. One which might be added is 
 Nagle v Feilden
[1966] 2 QB 633
, 648, 651. Reference has been made to four recent cases: 
 Rondel v Worsley
[1969] 1 AC 191
; 
 Wiseman v Borneman
 
[1969] 3 WLR 706
; 
 Roy v Prior
 
[1970] 1 QB 283
; and 
 Schmidt v Home Office
[1969] 2 Ch 149. In each of these cases there was an important question of principle involved, and the hearing of the application under RSC O 18 r 19 was much longer and more elaborate than is usual, but the final decision was that the alleged cause of action was clearly unsustainable, and so the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and was ordered to be struck out. There was no departure from the principle that the order for striking out should only be made if it becomes plain and obvious that the claim or defence cannot succeed, but the procedural method was unusual in that there was a relatively long and elaborate instead of a short and summary hearing.
 
 
 
... But, in the words of Sir Gordon Willmer in 
 Drummond-Jackson 
 at p 700, the question whether a point is plain and obvious does not depend upon the length of time it takes to argue. Rather the question is whether, when the point has been argued, it has become plain and obvious that there can be but one result.`
By para 12 of the statement of claim the plaintiffs alleged that the passage complained of and the box enlarged by the news reports and write-ups referred to herein: 
 
[I]n their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo bore the following meanings defamatory of the plaintiffs:
 
 
 
(i) that the deceased was murdered on 12 December 1984;
 
 
 
 
(ii) that by virtue of the above, the first plaintiff made a false police report on or around December 1984 stating, inter alia, that the deceased had been missing for more than one week; 
 
(iii) that by virtue of the above, the first plaintiff made a false affidavit on 23 August 1993 to state, inter alia, that the deceased had been missing since 10 December 1984; 
 
(iv) that the deceased was murdered in the caretaker`s quarters of the Orchard Road Presbyterian Church which happened to be the home of the fourth and fifth plaintiffs; 
 
(v) that the deceased was murdered in a certain manner pursuant to the findings of the Special Investigation Section of the CID as first reported in an edition of the first defendants` newspaper dated 27 March 1987; 
 
(vi) that the deceased was murdered in a certain manner as could only have been executed by the plaintiffs; 
 
(vii) that although the plaintiffs were charged for committing and abetting to commit the murder of the deceased sometime in March 1987 and subsequently released for lack of proof, it has nevertheless been conclusively proved that the deceased was murdered by the plaintiffs; 
 
(viii) that although it has been proved that the deceased was murdered by the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs cannot be prosecuted for the same because of certain legal technicalities.
  
 
 
The natural and ordinary meaning of the words in the passage complained of in the context in which they are set out is to be determined by the court according to what the words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and commonsense. See 
 Bank of China v Asiaweek 
 supra at p 508 where LP Thean J stated: 
 
... The natural and ordinary meanings of the words, in the context they are set out, is to be determined by the court. In 
 Slim & Ors v Daily Telegraph Ltd & Ors
 at pp 174-175, Diplock LJ said:
 
 
 
`... where an action for libel is tried by a judge alone without a jury, it is he who has to arrive at a single ""right"" meaning as ""the natural and ordinary meaning"" of the words complained of ...`
 
 
 
He repeated this at p 176: `But where a judge is sitting alone to try a libel action without a jury, the only questions he has to ask himself are: ""Is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words that which is alleged in the statement of claim?"" And: ""If not, what, if any, less injurious defamatory meaning do they bear?""
 
 
 
And at p 177 he said: 
 
`What then is this court to do? I do not think we need send it back for a retrial. No oral evidence given at the trial throws any light upon the natural and ordinary meaning of the words to readers of the correspondence columns in the 
 Daily Telegraph
. This court is in as good a position as the judge to determine what is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, and in so far as any action for libel can be a simple case, I think that this one is.`
 
 
 
In this case, I was in as good a position, on the hearing of the appeal, as a judge trying the action to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words.
 
 
 
What then is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of? The question is one purely of construction of the words, and the approach to be adopted in construing these words is to consider what meaning the words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons: para 4.04 of 
 Duncan and Neil on Defamation 
 (2nd Ed). Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in 
 Jones v Skelton 
 said at p 958: 
 
`The ordinary and natural meaning of words may be either the literal meaning or it may be an implied or inferred or any indirect meaning: any meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge but is a meaning which is capable of being detected in the language used can be a part of the ordinary and natural meaning of words (see 
 Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 [1963] 2 All ER 151). The ordinary and natural meaning may therefore include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader, guided not by any special but only by general knowledge and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction, would draw from the words. The test of reasonableness guides and directs the court in its function of deciding whether it is open to a jury in any particular case to hold that reasonable persons would understand the words complained of in a defamatory sense.`
 
 
 
The passage complained of does not refer to any of the plaintiffs. Neither do the words suggest in their natural and ordinary meaning that any of the plaintiffs was guilty of the murder of Muthu or that the first plaintiff made a false affidavit relating to the disappearance of Muthu as contended in para 12 of the statement of claim.
In the alternative, the plaintiffs claimed that by way of innuendo the passage complained of read in the context of the box and the news reports and write-ups in 
 The Straits Times 
 , bore the said defamatory meanings referred to in para 12 of the statement of claim.
In 
 Astaire v Campling & Anor 
 [1996] 1 WLR 34, the facts there according to the head-notes are that the plaintiff, a man well known in boxing circles and the holder of a manager`s licence, issued a writ for libel against the writer and publishers of an article which appeared in a Sunday newspaper on 3 November 1963. The article was critical of the plaintiff`s activities in the boxing world and identified him as `Mr X - a man well known in the fight game.` For some weeks prior to the publication of the article complained of extensive adverse publicity had been given to the activities of `Mr X` in a broadcast and in numerous articles in other newspapers with which the defendants had no connection. Paragraph 3 of the plaintiff`s statement of claim set out the whole of the alleged libel. Paragraph 4 alleged eight innuendoes. Paragraph 5 set out, as facts and matters relied on in support of the innuendoes, extracts from the broadcast and from 13 other articles relating to `Mr X` which had appeared in the other newspapers. The defendants applied under RSC O 18 r 19 to strike out paras 4 and 5 of the statement of claim on the ground that the facts and matters contained in para 5 were incapable of supporting the innuendoes and that therefore para 4 contained no cause of action. The Court of Appeal held that it was not permissible to impute a defamatory meaning to words which might be innocent in their natural and ordinary meaning by reason of and by reference to other allegedly defamatory statements made by other persons on other occasions, which had not been expressly adopted or repeated by the publishers of the statement in respect of which the action was brought. To give rise to a cause of action against such a publisher, the statement of fact or expression of opinion relied on as defamatory must be one which could reasonably be said to be contained, whether expressly or by implication, in the statement in respect of which the action was brought.
In delivering his judgment, Sellers LJ said at pp 38-39: 
 
Contrary to the plaintiff`s contention, the innuendoes in para 4, in my view, are not and cannot be derived from the article complained of in para 3 (which is the alleged libel) when read in the light of the extrinsic facts set out in the long para 5, but arise, if at all, in the material set out in that paragraph, sub-paras 3 to 18, for which the defendants are not responsible. A reasonable reader would not and could not attribute them or their implications to the defendants.
 
 
 
It may well be, that in circumstances where the identity of a plaintiff is not expressly referred to in an article, extrinsic evidence may be given to establish identity, but it seems to me a wholly different matter to seek to add to the alleged libel defamatory views expressed and published by somebody else. Counsel for the plaintiff relied on the decision as to identity and some of the observations in an American case in the last century, 
 Van Ingen v Mail & Express Publishing Co 
, and in his argument, and particularly in his final argument in reply, he laid stress on the following words to be found in the opinion given by Martin J, which was the majority opinion of the court. The judge said: 
 
`To determine the effect of the defendant`s article and to whom it applied, it would seem proper to show the condition of the public mind, the information the public possessed upon the subject of the article, and the consequent inference which it would readily draw from reading it.`
 
 
 
And in another passage:
 
 
 
`In other words, it seems to me that a defendant cannot publish a libel of another and shield himself by not disclosing the name of the person to whom it was intended to refer, when he knows and understands that by reason of former publications the public mind is in a condition where it would necessarily understand the article as applying to him alone.`
 
 
 
The public mind may no doubt be relevant in a case of identity, but if it has been affected by defamatory statements made by someone other than the defendant and not by the defendant, the article does not seem to me to make the defendant liable for anything more than it contains. It must be brought home by the evidence of innuendo to a reader that the article itself, which is the article complained of as the libel, has in the light of all the circumstances a defamatory meaning. In my view the facts set out in support of the innuendo do no such thing and I would dismiss this appeal.
 
 
 
The second defendant was not responsible for the publication of the news reports, write-ups and the box on `The Curry Murder` case and neither had it adopted or repeated them. Therefore no defamatory meaning should be imputed to the passage complained of by reason of and by reference to these other allegedly defamatory statements.
Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed with costs.

s 268 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
The petitioner under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) sought criminal revision of a decision of a district judge accepting a supposed plea of guilt by the petitioner and sentencing him to nine months` imprisonment. The revision was granted, the sentence set aside and the case was remitted for a new trial before another district judge. Since the appellant was in prison all this while, and no bail was granted, it was also ordered that an early date be set for the new trial.
 Brief facts 
The petitioner was charged with the commission of an outrage of modesty punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He appeared before the district judge on 29 January 1996. The petitioner was unrepresented then. The notes taken by the district judge were brief and are reproduced in full: 
 
Prosecutor: One charge against accused. May plea be taken.
 
 
 
Charge read explained and understood in Tamil. Pleads guilty. Understands nature and consequences of the plea. Statement of facts read (`A`).
 
 
 
Accused admits to statement of facts. Nothing known. Mitigation: Done unintentionally. Very crowded and he was pushed forward and unintentionally he touched her. 
 
Court: Why admit to the statement of facts?
 
 
 
 
Accused: I came here to work. If I did not admit it I would not have any ways of proving I did not do it. Did not want to go through the trouble.
  
 
 
 
Prosecutor: May matter be stood down so I can explain matter to him. 
 
Court: Stand down to 10.05am.
  
 
 
10.05am court resumed
Accused: Wishes to withdraw the last mitigation. Further mitigation: Remanded since 2 January 1996. Spent a lot of money in India to work here. Worked here the past three years. Family facing financial difficulties. Please impose lenient sentence and to backdate sentence. 
Prosecutor: No submission on sentencing. Confirm remanded since 2 January 1996. 
Court: Nine months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Imprisonment with effect from 2 January 1996.
 
 
 
 
 
 The petition 
 
 
 
In his petition for revision, the petitioner disclosed that no appeal was filed as he was ignorant of the procedures. That being so, he sought to challenge the decision of the trial court as being flawed. The flaws he identified were that he was unrepresented, that the trial court failed to examine him carefully, that the explanation of the effect of his first mitigation ought not to have been done by the prosecutor, that the petitioner was under duress to plead guilty, that the plea was thus made out of desperation, and finally that the petitioner was innocent and desired an opportunity to defend himself.
In his arguments before this court, counsel for the petitioner noted a number of points concerning the decision and judgment of the district judge. First, it was pointed out that the district judge failed to record any conviction before sentencing, contrary to s 180(b) CPC, which is mandatory. It was also contended that the trial court failed to ensure that the petitioner understood the nature and consequence of his plea of guilt, and whether the petitioner in fact intended to admit without qualification the charge against him. That it was the prosecutor who explained the effect of his first mitigation was irregular, and this ought to have been done by the court. Indeed, the petitioner`s first mitigation could not be regarded as an unequivocal plea of guilt, which meant that a plea of not guilty ought to have been recorded. Finally, it was also said that the court failed to explain to the petitioner that he could defend himself if he wished to plead his innocence.
 The respondent`s case 
The respondent`s case was directed to the grounds of petition. It was contended by the respondent that the fact that the petitioner was unrepresented did not impugn the proceedings. The court had also allowed the petitioner the opportunity to reassess his earlier plea, and neither was the petitioner denied a fair hearing. The act of the prosecuting officer in explaining the consequences of the petitioner`s mitigation was one done as part of her role as an officer of the court. No grievances were voiced by the petitioner then against the prosecuting officer. As for the petitioner`s allegation that the prosecutor had coerced the petitioner into pleading guilt, the respondent contended that this amounted to the adducing of fresh evidence, which required a motion to the court. It was finally said that the petitioner ought not be granted the revision as there had been a long delay.
Before this court, the respondent added that the failure to record a conviction was a mere irregularity which could be cured under s 396, CPC.
 The issues 
The crucial points which arose for determination were:
 
 
(1) Whether the failure to record the conviction was fatal. 
 
(2) The effect of the initial mitigation.
  
 
 
1 Failure to record the conviction
The primary issue in this revision was whether the failure to record a conviction as required by s 180(n)(ii), CPC - and not s 180(b) - was a fatal irregularity which could not be cured by s 396 CPC.
Section 180 reads, in its relevant portions: 
 
The following procedure shall be observed by Magistrate`s Courts and District Courts in summary trials:
 
 
 
...
(b) if the accused pleads guilty to a charge whether as originally framed or as amended, the plea shall be recorded and he may be convicted on it:
 
 
 
 
Provided that before a plea of guilty is recorded the court shall ascertain that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him; 
 
... 
 
(n) (ii) if the court finds the accused guilty or a plea of guilty is recorded against him, it shall record a conviction and pass sentence according to law either forthwith or on such day as the court may appoint;
  
 
 
While s 396 reads: 
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of -
 
 
 
(a) any error omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceeding under this Code;
 
 
 
 
(b) the want of any sanction required by section 129; or 
 
(c) the improper admission or rejection of any evidence,
  
 
 
unless the error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or want has occasioned a failure of justice.
 
 
 
The petitioner argued that s 396 had no application in this case for it had to be read subject to the mandatory nature of s 180. The prosecution on the other hand contended that s 396 was only to be read subject to the provision preceding it in its chapter of the CPC, namely, s 395, which reads: 
 
(1) No finding or sentence pronounced or passed shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed unless in the opinion of the appellate court a failure of justice has been occasioned thereby.
 
 
 
 
(2) If the appellate court thinks that a failure of justice has been occasioned by an omission to frame a charge it shall order a new trial shall be held.
  
 
 
The difficulty with the prosecution`s approach was that it seemed redundant to make s 396 subject to s 395. Since s 396 is a curative provision, which removes the taint of any irregularity, the plain reading of a saving clause would be that s 396 would not apply as regards specific sections, failure to abide by which would not be curable. Section 395 on the other hand is also curative, and it makes no sense to have a saving clause for such a provision.
Guidance on the subject may be derived from Indian authorities. Section 465(1) of the Indian Code is in the same terms. The interpretation of the phrase `subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained` has not been consistent. In 
 Raj Chander Mazumdar v G Chander Mazumdar 
(1895)ILR 22 Cal 176 and 
 Jogesh Chandra Bhattacharjee 
(1896)ILR 23 Cal 983, the view taken was that this refers only to the immediately preceding sections of the same chapter.
But while the majority of the court in 
 Ram Subhag Singh v Emperor 
(1915) 16 Cri LJ 641 held that s 396 was only subject to the preceding provisions of the same chapter, the minority thought that it was subject to the whole of the preceding code. Subsequently in 
 Bhajja v Emperor 
 All 238, Allsop J took an intermediate line, holding that the equivalent of s 396 had to be read subject to the preceding provisions of the chapter, unless there was a specific provision in any other part of the Code which specified that an error will vitiate proceedings despite there being no failure of justice.
The issue is thus far free from authority locally. It must be noted though that reading the Indian equivalent of s 396 as subject only to preceding provisions in the same chapter makes some sense in India when it is noted that in the Indian Code there are a number of provisions preceding s 465 in the same chapter dealing with various irregularities, some of which, as listed in the present s 461, render the decision of the magistrate void. Similarly in the Straits Settlements Code of 1910, there were two other provisions in the same chapter as the equivalents of s 396 and s 395, dealing with proceedings being held in the wrong place, and the irregular taking of confessions. However, there was in 1910 and afterwards no provision in that chapter which vitiated proceedings totally without any test of material injustice. The restricted reading is even less tenable at present when the only other preceding provision in the chapter is s 395. Thus, whatever the original intention may have been, the only way the phrase `subject to provisions hereinbefore contained` can make sense is if it were read subject to all preceding provisions in the code.
But this cannot mean that the operation of s 396 is excluded by provisions which are cast in mandatory terms. Most provisions in the code governing procedure in the courts are couched using the word `shall`. If all such provisions have to be regarded as outside the ambit of s 396 then breach of most provisions of the code would be fatal, regardless of the gravity or seriousness of the breach. This is unreasonable. Taking s 180 as an example, it may be noted that though the section as a whole is expressed in mandatory terms, the various aspects of the trial covered by it vary in their importance and the impact of infringement upon an accused person. For example, the failure to allow the accused to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution goes to the heart of the adversarial process, and breach of that would probably have to be regarded as an illegality. On the other hand, for example, the failure to record a plea of guilt would not go as far, and the effect of such failure would have to be weighed. In the view of this court, where no injustice is caused to the accused, such an error is amenable to being cured under s 396. There is nothing in s 396 itself which would restrict its application only to those provisions which are merely directory or confer a discretion upon the court.
Support for the approach adopted is derived from a number of Indian cases. The Appeals Board of the Privy Council has in a number of cases (
 Subramania Iyer v King-Emperor 
 (1915)28 IA 257, 
 Babulal Choukhani v Emperor 
 PC 30, 
 Pulukuri Kotayya v Emperor 
 PC 67) drawn a distinction between illegalities and irregularities. Though this is not reflected in the code, the distinction, which is one of degree, draws a line between those errors that go to the mode of the trial, which would be illegalities, and those which affect merely the conduct of it, which would be irregularities. Furthermore, where a mandatory provision of the code has not been adhered to, it is doubtful that that would be fatal to the trial even if no prejudice has been caused to the accused (
 Alimahomed v Kasturchand 
 (1938) 41 Bom LR 90). This is supported by 
 Pulukuri Kotayya 
 where the prosecution failed, as required by s 162 of the Indian Code, to supply the defence with statements. Section 162 was acknowledged by the Privy Council to be an important provision, but, in the view of the Board, a distinction had to be drawn between the manner or mode of trial and the conduct of it. Breach of the latter is curable by the equivalent of s 396. Sir John Beaumont, delivering the judgment of the Board, said, at p 75: 
 
When a trial is conducted in a manner different from that prescribed by the Code (as in 
 NA Subramania Iyer`s
case) the trial is bad, and no question of curing an irregularity arises; but if the trial is conducted substantially in the manner prescribed by the Code, but some irregularity occurs in the course of such conduct, the irregularity can be cured under s 537 [the equivalent of s 396], and none the less so because the irregularity involves, as must nearly always be the case, a breach of one or more of the very comprehensive provisions of the Code. The distinction drawn in many of the cases in India between an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree rather than of kind.
 
 
 
In the Federated Malay States, the Court of Appeal had to consider whether the failure to record a conviction of a person amounted to an irregularity which could be cured by s 422, the equivalent of s 396. The case of 
 S Govindasamy v PP 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 101
  involved an accused who had been convicted by the High Court, consisting of a judge sitting with assessors. The code required the judge to give judgment where he agreed with the assessors. The record failed to show that the judge gave any judgment. That record only stated as follows: 
 
Assessors without retiring both find accused guilty of murder.
 
 
 
It was thus not stated in the record that the judge agreed with the assessors, or that he convicted the accused. It was found by the Court of Appeal that this was not a mere irregularity, and could not be cured by the equivalent of s 396.
Subsequently the same court, with two of the judges who heard 
 Govindasamy 
 , heard the appeal of 
 Wong Heng v PP 
 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 127
 . In this case, the accused was again found guilty by assessors; the judge in this case recorded his agreement with them, but failed, as required by s 198(1) of the Federation Code, to record the conviction. Only the sentence was noted. 
 Govindasamy 
 distinguished by the Court of Appeal as involving a more serious omission, that of recording the judge`s agreement with both assessors. Unlike the earlier case, the Court of Appeal in 
 Wong Heng 
that there was no doubt that the judge had brought his mind to bear on the innocence of the accused. The court noted that the failure to record a conviction contravened s 198(i) which reads: 
 
If the Court agrees with the opinion of both assessors, or where the assessors are of different opinions with the opinion of one assessor the Court shall give judgment accordingly.
 
 
 
But in the view of the court, citing 
 Pulukuri Kotayya 
, a failure to observe s 198 could be cured by s 422. It must be noted that the court did so despite the mandatory wording of s 198.
Thus a failure to record the conviction as required by s 180(n)(ii) is an irregularity which can be cured under s 396. In the circumstances of this petition, no injustice was caused by the failure to record the conviction. The petitioner then was left only with the arguments based on whether his plea of guilt had been withdrawn.
2 Modification of the mitigation plea
While the petitioner did plead guilty, he said in his mitigation that the act of molest was done unintentionally. In the circumstances this was a disowning of both intention and knowledge.
Section 354 of the Penal Code reads: 
 
Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any two of such punishments.
 
 
 
Sections 350 and 351 Penal Code which deal with criminal force and assault, similarly require either intention or knowledge.
The material facts to be admitted were that: 
 
When the accused [the petitioner] walked passed [sic] the victim, he used his hand and pressed her crotch.
 
 
 
It was apparent then that the mitigation plea was a denial of the admitted facts, and that the petitioner committed any wrong. Notwithstanding his earlier admission of the facts, there was then some doubt that the petitioner understood the nature and consequences of his plea and that he had intended to admit the offence without qualification.
The issue then was whether that denial ought to have been accepted without more by the district judge. The petitioner cited the case of 
 Koh Mui Keow v R 
 
 
 
[1952] MLJ 214
  for the proposition that the court had to be satisfied that the petitioner was indeed pleading guilty on his own accord. On the facts, the district judge did not contravene that principle for he had attempted to satisfy himself that the petitioner was indeed pleading guilty, asking the petitioner why he admitted to the prosecution facts if he claimed the act was accidental. This court would be reluctant to go so far as to require that a magistrate or district judge treat, without further investigation, every mitigation plea which discloses the possibility of a denial of the admitted facts as constituting a modification of a plea of guilt.
However, what happened next was that it was the prosecutor who made a request in the following words: 
 
May the matter be stood down so I can explain matter to him.
 
 
 
The petitioner then withdrew his mitigation and submitted another basis for leniency.
The petitioner contended that it was not for the prosecutor to take it upon herself to explain the matter to him. This court agreed with that. While the prosecutor is undoubtedly an officer of the court, and has a role to play in assisting the court in its deliberations, it is for the court below to be satisfied that the plea of guilt is made unequivocally. Even though this is not expressly provided for in the CPC, it arises from the stipulation in s 180(b) that the court has to be satisfied that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea. On the facts of this petition, the court below could not be said to have been properly satisfied that the accused understood the nature and consequences of his plea. And the failure to do so was not curable by s 396, for it caused an injustice since the petitioner was unrepresented. The adversarial nature of criminal proceedings was a further reason why it was not appropriate for the explanation, whatever that may have meant, to have been made by the prosecutor.
It was clear to this court that there was no evidence of any misconduct by the prosecutor, who apparently was indeed trying her best to assist the court below. Be that as it may, there was no sufficient satisfaction by the court below that the plea of guilt was not unequivocal. The irregularity in the proceedings being extant and incurable, the withdrawal of the initial mitigation and the subsequent alternative mitigation was of no effect.
 Revision and orders 
In the circumstances, the conviction of the petitioner was a palpable injustice which warranted the granting of revision. Contrary to the contention of the prosecution, there was no significant or material delay by the petitioner in taking out these proceedings.
The petitioner had sought quashing of the conviction, but this court was not minded to do so for, as the record stood, there was in fact no conviction. However, the sentence was set aside, and pursuant to s 268 the case was remitted for an early retrial in another court below.
